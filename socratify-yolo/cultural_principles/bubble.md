- **Principles/Values:**
  - **Mission:** "Our mission at Bubble is to erase the distinction between software use and software creation"
  - **Empowerment:** "Based on the principle of empowerment, not disruption. This value centers on expanding access to technology creation. Bubble believes in making software development accessible to everyone, not just technical specialists"
  - **Genuineness:** "This value emphasizes building trust through transparency and authentic communication. Bubble fosters an environment where people can be themselves and focuses on empathy and accountability in customer relations"
  - **User-centricity:** "This places user needs and success at the forefront of every decision. Bubble prioritizes features that support long-term user success and continuously adapts the platform based on user feedback, releasing over 1,000 feature updates annually"
  - **Kindness:** "Represents Bubble's commitment to creating a supportive, community-focused environment"
  - **Founding Principles:** "Every piece of new tech should ideally make something that was once complicated simpler or easier, improving people's lives along the way. Programming and coding are distinct skills - programming is about logical thinking and app structure, while coding is about technical implementation"
  - **Core Philosophy:** "Programming should be accessible to everyone, not just specialists. Technology creation is too important to be limited to a small group of experts. Everyone should be able to shape the technological world around them"
