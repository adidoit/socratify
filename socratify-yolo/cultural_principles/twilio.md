### Twilio

- **Principles/Values:**
  - **We are Builders:** "Love hard problems, believe in people's power to create, reject 'can't be done' attitudes, and solve challenging customer problems through bold ideas and fearless iteration"
  - **We are Owners:** "Take accountability, take the long view, sweat the details, and feel empowered and accountable for outcomes"
  - **We are Curious:** "See ourselves as works in progress, humbly seek truth, strive to learn from mistakes, and seek continual progress over perfection"
  - **We are Positrons:** "Be genuine in helping and empowering others, believe caring is critical, and stand up for what is good and right"
  - **Builder Tools:** "Wear the customers' shoes, draw the owl (embrace uncertainty), write things down, organize into small teams, live the spirit of challenge, learn cheap lessons"
  - **Owner Tools:** "Trust is the #1 thing we sell, think long term, have a point of view, ruthlessly prioritize, be frugal, pick up the trash, disagree and commit"
  - **Curious Tools:** "Be humble, embrace the uncomfortable, seek the truth, share problems not solutions, seek progress over perfection"
  - **Positron Tools:** "Be genuine, no shenanigans, empower others, be inclusive, be respectful, ask how you can help"
