### Robinhood

- **Principles/Values:**
  - **Mission:** "To democratize finance for all"
  - **Collaboration and Trust:** "We're all invested in the same mission. We earn each other's trust through honesty, inclusion, and respect. We invite contrary perspectives, support each other, and debate with energy and kindness. Once decisions are made, we move in unison with ownership and accountability, powered by the thrill of building something great together."
  - **Leveling the Playing Field:** "We level the playing field. We started a movement, breaking barriers so everyone—not just the wealthy—can access the financial system. The elites always find a way to get nicer things, which means our job to 'democratize finance for all' may never be complete — which is what makes it so fun."
  - **Innovation and Independent Thinking:** "We only follow the crowd when they're right. We're innovators and problem solvers. We use data, empirical truth, and experiments to inform decisions. Our bold bets often make us a first mover, and we do what's right for customers - even if it hasn't been done before."
  - **Accessibility and Inclusivity:** "Accessibility and Inclusivity are central to Robinhood's mission to democratize finance. Offering fractional shares allows individuals with limited capital to participate in the market, and the mobile-first platform is designed for ease of use, making it accessible to a broad audience."
  - **Transparency:** "Transparency is a key value for Robinhood, ensuring that customers are well-informed and confident in their investment decisions. The platform provides clear information on stock prices and market trends, empowering users."
  - **Education:** "Education is core to accomplishing our mission. We believe access to easy-to-understand investment information and education is fundamental to expanding participation in the U.S. financial system."
