### Discord

- **Principles/Values:**
  - **Mission:** "Discord's mission is to create a voice, video, and text communication platform that serves as the perfect place to talk for over two hundred million people to hang out and connect with their friends"
  - **Cultivate Belonging:** "Take the time to get to know people and find common ground. Remember that we are all working towards the same goal. Start from a place of trust, assume good intent, and seek to understand other points of view before passing judgment"
  - **Deliver for Customers:** "Deliver solutions that meet the needs of the people we serve. Strive to deeply understand how what you are working on helps customers from first principles and invent creative approaches to meet them"
  - **Surprise & Delight:** "Surprise & delight comes from caring about the million little details of how a person experiences your work. Put the right emotion in when they least expect it to deliver the magic. This applies to how we show up with each other too!"
  - **Debate, Decide, Commit:** "When you own a decision, involve your stakeholders, get informed through data, have constructive debates, and make a decision. When a decision is made, regardless of whether you agree with it, commit to bringing it to life with excellence"
  - **Progress Over Perfection:** "All big things start small. Think long-term and break ideas down so you can start delivering value and learning right away. Strive for an 80/20 approach and compound from there"
  - **Embrace the Brutal Facts:** "Take risks (big and small) to do things that matter and don't be afraid to change directions based on what you learn. Inspect reality — using data when you can — to determine whether it is working or not"
  - **Strive for Excellence:** "Seize the opportunity to do incredible work that you can be proud of every single day. Learn more, ask questions, improve yourself, improve our company, and help those around you reach their maximum potential"
