## Company Overview
ExxonMobil is one of the world's largest publicly traded energy providers and chemical manufacturers, committed to delivering energy that modern life depends on while maintaining the highest standards of safety and environmental responsibility.

## Core Guiding Philosophy

> "Protect Tomorrow. Today. is the guiding principle behind our approach to sustainability. It drives our mindset to be the most responsible operator in our industry."

## Safety Excellence

### Personnel Safety Leadership
ExxonMobil aspires to have a working environment where "Nobody Gets Hurt," demonstrating industry-leading performance:

> "0.02 industry-leading lost-time incident rate (LTIR) per 200,000 work hours in 2023 – maintained our 0.02 LTIR in 2024"

> "Zero high-consequence product stewardship-related incidents in our Fuels, Lubricants, and Chemicals businesses again in 2024"

### Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS)
> "We focus on continuous improvement through our Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS), which sets expectations for managing the risks inherent to our business. Our OIMS establishes expectations that apply across all our operations to address risks inherent to our business, including environmental risks. The OIMS framework contains 11 elements related to leadership, operations and maintenance, community relations, emergency response, incident investigation and information and documentation, among others."

## Operational Excellence

### Process Safety Excellence
> "Our objective is to help protect our people, communities, and the environment by successfully managing and enhancing process safety. The primary purpose of process safety is to keep hydrocarbons, chemicals, and process water controlled and safely managed through all phases of our operations. Our Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS) is the core of how we manage process safety risks."

### Standards Framework
> "Our Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS) framework meets International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 environmental management system standards and the requirements of American Chemistry Council Responsible Care®. Our global network of more than 20 lubricant plants is ISO 14001-certified – an indicator of the effectiveness of OIMS."

## Sustainability Principles

### Environmental Excellence
> "We pursue environmental excellence every day, because we know it's not just what we do that matters, but also how we do it."

Key environmental focus areas include:
- Reducing potential impacts on ecosystems and protecting the value they provide to nature and people
- Safeguarding water resources by prudently managing and monitoring our water use – with a focus on the quality and supply of freshwater
- Meeting or exceeding environmental regulatory requirements and working to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
- Incorporating best practices to manage and treat waste

### Water Stewardship Achievement
> "Used recycled produced, brackish or reclaimed sources to supply 98% of the water in our Permian Basin hydraulic fracturing operations in 2024"

### Lower-Emission Investments
> "We're pursuing up to $30 billion in lower-emission investments between 2025 and 2030 – and we're on track with our 2030 emission-intensity reduction plans, which we actively steward as part of our business plans."

### 2024 Sustainability Achievements
> "In 2024, announced a $200 million investment to expand advanced recycling capacity to 500 million pounds"

> "Diverted from landfill >95% of waste produced in their global network of lubricants blending and packaging plants in 2023 and 2024"

### Sustainability Integration
> "Learn how we integrate sustainability into our operations through rigorous standards, ethical conduct, and strategic priorities."

## Business Conduct Standards

> "Our Standards of Business Conduct demonstrate our commitment to be a good neighbor in the places we operate around the world. Respecting human rights is important to the well-being of our communities. It's embedded into our policies, processes, and due diligence practices."
