### OpenAI

- **Principles/Values:**
  - **Mission:** "To ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work—benefits all of humanity"
  - **Alternative Mission:** "To build safe AI, and ensure AI's benefits are as widely and evenly distributed as possible"
  - **Beneficial Use:** "They commit to use any influence they obtain over AGI's deployment to ensure it is used for the benefit of all, and to avoid enabling uses of AI or AGI that harm humanity or unduly concentrate power"
  - **Cooperation:** "They will actively cooperate with other research and policy institutions; they seek to create a global community working together to address AGI's global challenges"
  - **Public Goods:** "They are committed to providing public goods that help society navigate the path to AGI"
  - **Embracing Uncertainty:** "They treat safety as a science, learning from iterative deployment rather than just theoretical principles"
  - **Defense in Depth:** "They stack interventions to create safety through redundancy"
  - **Methods that Scale:** "They work to develop safety methods that can scale with AI capabilities"
  - **Human Control:** "They work to develop AI that elevates humanity and promotes democratic ideals"
  - **Community Effort:** "They believe safety requires community-wide effort and collaboration"
  - **Mission Focus:** "Managing safety, tackling problems, and being customer-focused"
