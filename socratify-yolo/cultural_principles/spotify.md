### Spotify

- **Principles/Values:**
  - **Mission:** "To unlock the potential of human creativity by giving a million creators the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by it"
  - **Innovative:** "We're all pioneers. We're original and creative in our thinking. To us, innovation is a default mind-set – a hard wired desire to improve things. We move fast and take big risks. We cultivate curiosity. We're unafraid to fail"
  - **Collaborative:** "We're all Spotify. We're stronger together. The better we collaborate, the more effective we are. When we're working well across functions, we're unstoppable. We recognize that we're all in this together"
  - **Sincere:** "We mean it. The best relationships are based on mutual trust and respect. We want to be fair and transparent in everything we do. We don't micro-manage, we trust each other to do a great job. We have no time for internal politics"
  - **Passionate:** "We feel it. We're proud of what we've achieved, and passionate about where we're going. We like being bold. We're not afraid of taking big bets, or getting them wrong. We all share a passion to learn and grow"
  - **Playful:** "We say yes to fun. Let's be honest, we have bands playing in the office – it kind of sets the tone. We're a playful company and a playful brand. We always have been. We never take ourselves too seriously"
  - **Change is our constant:** "Embrace continuous evolution"
  - **Growth is our mantra:** "Prioritize personal and professional development"
  - **Ideas drive us, not bureaucracy:** "Reject traditional corporate hierarchies"
