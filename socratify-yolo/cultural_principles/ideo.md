## Mission Statement

**"We believe a better future is for all of us to design."**

## Core Philosophy

### Human-Centered Design Approach
IDEO's foundational belief that design should:
- Start with understanding human needs and behaviors
- Create solutions that are desirable, feasible, and viable
- Prioritize empathy and deep user research
- Focus on improving people's lives through thoughtful design

### Design Thinking Methodology
The systematic approach that IDEO pioneered:
- **Empathize**: Gain deep understanding through research and observation
- **Define**: Synthesize observations to identify core problems
- **Ideate**: Generate a wide range of creative solutions
- **Prototype**: Build representations of ideas to learn and iterate
- **Test**: Gather feedback to refine and improve solutions

## Core Values

### 1. **Diversity as Essential Ingredient**
**"We believe diversity—of backgrounds, opinions, experiences, and disciplines—is an essential ingredient in every design challenge."**

This commitment manifests through:
- Multidisciplinary teams bringing different perspectives
- Inclusive hiring and team composition practices
- Valuing different cultural and professional backgrounds
- Creating environments where diverse voices are heard and valued

### 2. **Experimentation and Learning**
Embracing failure as part of the innovation process:
- Rapid prototyping to test and learn quickly
- "Fail early, fail often, fail cheap" mentality
- Continuous iteration and improvement
- Learning from both successes and setbacks

### 3. **Collaborative Innovation**
Building solutions through collective intelligence:
