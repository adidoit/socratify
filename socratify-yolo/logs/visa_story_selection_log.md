### 2. visa-apple-card-contrarian.json ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Why Selected**: Excellent contrarian framework challenging conventional partnership wisdom

## REJECTED EXERCISES (Moved to Fail Folder)

### 4. visa-apple-card-trade_off.json ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Why Rejected**: Strong but not top tier - edge case selection
- **Issue**: While solid trade-off analysis, the top 3 provide better comprehensive coverage
- **Reasoning**: $100M trade-off timing less engaging than assumption/contrarian frameworks

### 5. visa-apple-card-data.json ⭐⭐⭐
**Why Rejected**: Middle tier - predictable answers reduce discovery value
- **Issue**: User behavior data needs somewhat predictable (payment adoption, spending patterns)
- **Reasoning**: Less cognitive challenge compared to assumption and contrarian exercises

### 6. visa-apple-card-define_success.json ⭐⭐⭐
**Why Rejected**: Middle tier - success metrics fairly obvious
- **Issue**: Success measurement for $100M investment fairly predictable (volume, market share)
- **Reasoning**: Less engaging discovery than core strategic analysis exercises

### 7. visa-apple-card-elevator_pitch.json ⭐⭐⭐
**Why Rejected**: Middle tier - defensive positioning reduces strategic insight
- **Issue**: Mastercard defensive pitch, less about proactive strategic thinking
- **Reasoning**: Reactive rather than strategic analysis, less learning value

### 8. visa-apple-card-response.json ⭐⭐
**Why Rejected**: Lower tier - predictable competitive responses
- **Issue**: Mastercard's defensive responses fairly obvious (higher offers, better terms)
- **Reasoning**: Response exercises generally provide less strategic depth and insight

## Strategic Rationale

The selected top 3 exercises provide:

1. **Complete Strategic Analysis**:
   - **Investment Logic**: Why pay $100M for future access (ASSUMPTION)
   - **Partnership Risks**: What dangers are overlooked in praised deal (CONTRARIAN)
   - **Control Strategy**: How Apple should gain payment ecosystem control (OPTIONS)

2. **Maximum Learning Value**:
   - Assumption analysis for strategic investment understanding
   - Contrarian thinking for partnership risk recognition
   - Strategic option evaluation for control vs. partnership trade-offs

3. **Perfect Complementarity**:
   - **Financial Reasoning** → **Strategic Risks** → **Control Alternatives**
   - Complete coverage of payment ecosystem competition dynamics
   - Each exercise teaches different core business analysis skill

4. **Excellent Goldilocks Zone Execution**:
   - All three have clear focus with multiple valid exploration paths
   - Perfect business puzzles without dominant obvious answers
   - Accessible without deep payments industry expertise
   - Genuine strategic tensions that invite debate

## Impact Assessment

**Quality Improvement**: The remaining 3 exercises represent the highest-quality examples of:
- Strategic investment assumption analysis (why pay massive upfront for future access)
- Contrarian partnership risk assessment (hidden dangers in praised opportunities)
- Strategic option evaluation for ecosystem control (build vs. partner decisions)

**Learning Optimization**: Students receive comprehensive strategic analysis training across complementary exercise types while maintaining consistent high quality and business authenticity throughout the payment network competition case study.

**Business Authenticity**: All three present realistic scenarios with accurate financial stakes ($100M upfront payments, 12M+ Apple Card users) and authentic strategic dynamics in the competitive payments industry.
