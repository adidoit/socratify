# YouTube Won - Top 3 Selection Log

## Story Overview
**Story**: youtube-won  
**Original Count**: 9 exercises  
**Target Count**: 3 exercises  
**Rejected Count**: 6 exercises  

## Business Context
YouTube dominates TV viewership by spending billions on sports rights (NFL Sunday Ticket $2B/year), shifting from user-generated content platform to "traditional TV" competitor, creating strategic tensions about identity, costs, and monetization.

## Selection Methodology
Applied comprehensive evaluation framework focusing on:
1. **Goldilocks Zone Compliance** - Clear focus with multiple valid exploration paths
2. **Pedagogical Quality** - Zone of proximal development, accessibility, scaffolding  
3. **Business Fidelity** - Realistic scenarios, accurate strategic context

## SELECTED EXERCISES (Top 3)

### 1. youtube-won-assumption.json ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Why Selected**: Perfect business puzzle with excellent Goldilocks Zone execution
- **Key Question**: "YouTube pays $2 billion yearly for NFL Sunday Ticket rights. They're putting these games on their free service anyway. What do you think they're assuming about viewers?"
- **Strengths**:
  - Perfect business paradox: expensive content given away free
  - Multiple valid assumptions (ad tolerance, viewing habits, loyalty, targeting value)
  - Accessible without sports industry expertise required
  - Excellent mental model integration
  - Forces deep thinking about monetization logic
- **Learning Value**: Teaches assumption analysis and business model reasoning

### 2. youtube-won-contrarian.json ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Why Selected**: Excellent contrarian framework challenging conventional wisdom
- **Key Question**: "YouTube shifts from 'alternative to TV' to 'king of TV.' Industry experts praise this as market dominance. What core values might this shift erode?"
- **Strengths**:
  - Perfect contrarian setup: celebrated success vs. hidden strategic costs
  - Multiple valid value erosions (spontaneity, creator focus, community identity)
  - Forces critical thinking about strategic trade-offs
  - Accessible - everyone understands YouTube's unique identity vs. traditional TV
  - Challenges groupthink about "winning"
- **Learning Value**: Teaches contrarian analysis and strategic cost recognition

### 3. youtube-won-options.json ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Why Selected**: Strong strategic alternatives exercise with good differentiation
- **Key Question**: "YouTube wants to be the universal gateway for internet video. They are rapidly improving their TV app. What other options should they explore to achieve this?"
- **Strengths**:
  - Clear strategic expansion challenge
  - Multiple distinct paths (super-aggregator, device integration, content partnerships)
  - Good philosophical differentiation between choices
  - Realistic competitive expansion scenarios
  - Complements assumption and contrarian exercises well
- **Learning Value**: Teaches strategic option evaluation and competitive expansion thinking

## REJECTED EXERCISES (Moved to Fail Folder)

### 4. youtube-won-data.json ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Why Rejected**: Strong but not top tier - predictable answers reduce discovery value
- **Issue**: While solid exercise, data needs for sports monetization somewhat predictable
- **Reasoning**: Ad behavior data obviously critical, less cognitive challenge than top 3

### 5. youtube-won-define_success.json ⭐⭐⭐
**Why Rejected**: Middle tier - success metrics somewhat obvious
- **Issue**: TV dominance metrics fairly predictable (viewing hours, market share)
- **Reasoning**: Less engaging discovery than assumption and contrarian exercises

### 6. youtube-won-elevator_pitch.json ⭐⭐⭐
**Why Rejected**: Middle tier - competitor perspective reduces direct learning value
- **Issue**: Warner Bros. perspective, less about YouTube's strategy directly
- **Reasoning**: Indirect learning about YouTube's strategic challenges

### 7. youtube-won-questions.json ⭐⭐⭐
**Why Rejected**: Middle tier - creator retention questions somewhat predictable
- **Issue**: Information priorities around creator loyalty fairly obvious
- **Reasoning**: Less cognitive challenge compared to assumption analysis

### 8. youtube-won-response.json ⭐⭐
**Why Rejected**: Lower tier - limited strategic depth, obvious responses
- **Issue**: Responses to Netflix creator poaching predictable (better pay, more support)
- **Reasoning**: Response exercises generally provide less strategic insight

### 9. youtube-won-trade_off.json ⭐⭐
**Why Rejected**: Lower tier - unclear trade-off structure, weak choice differentiation
- **Issue**: "When does this balance make sense" creates timing-based rather than strategic analysis
- **Reasoning**: Choices are variations not distinct strategic philosophies

## Strategic Rationale

The selected top 3 exercises provide:

1. **Complete Strategic Analysis**:
   - **Monetization Logic**: Why give away expensive content (ASSUMPTION)
   - **Strategic Costs**: What gets lost in TV pivot (CONTRARIAN)  
   - **Growth Paths**: How to extend video dominance (OPTIONS)

2. **Maximum Learning Value**:
   - Assumption analysis for business model understanding
   - Contrarian thinking for strategic cost recognition
   - Strategic option evaluation for competitive expansion

3. **Perfect Complementarity**:
   - Financial logic → Strategic risks → Growth alternatives
   - Comprehensive coverage of YouTube's TV strategy pivot

4. **Excellent Goldilocks Zone Execution**:
   - All three have clear focus with multiple valid exploration paths
   - No dominant obvious answers that kill discussion
   - Accessible without deep media industry expertise

## Impact Assessment

**Quality Improvement**: The remaining 3 exercises represent the highest-quality examples of:
- Business model assumption analysis (financial logic puzzle)
- Contrarian strategic thinking (challenging success narratives)
- Strategic option evaluation (competitive expansion paths)

**Learning Optimization**: Students receive comprehensive strategic analysis training across complementary exercise types while maintaining consistent high quality and business authenticity throughout the YouTube TV pivot case study.
