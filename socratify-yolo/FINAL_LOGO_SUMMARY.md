## Notes on Logo Naming

Some logos exist with slight naming variations. For example:
- "DHL Group (Deutsche Post)" → saved as "DHL_Group.png"
- "Berkshire Hathaway" → saved as "Berkshire_Hathaway.png"
- "Johnson & Johnson" → might be saved as "Johnson_Johnson.png"

The matching algorithm tries to account for these variations, but exact string matching may still show discrepancies.

## Remaining Work

For companies beyond the top 1000 that still need logos:
1. Run `python3 download_all_missing_logos.py` after modifying rank filter
2. For specific companies, search "[Company Name] logo transparent PNG" on Google
3. Check company investor relations or press pages for official logos

## File Locations

- **Logo directory**: `../socratify-images/logos/images/companies/`
- **Scripts directory**: Current directory (`/Users/adi/code/socratify/socratify-yolo/`)
- **Downloaded logos**: Moved from `downloaded_logos/` and `critical_logos/` to main directory

All logos are in PNG format with transparent backgrounds where available.
