    "happyPath": "Christie's, the historic art auction house, now sells AI art that artists accuse of plagiarism. This move challenges traditional art market values. The auction house aims to attract new buyers, but risks its reputation for trust by legitimizing this controversial digital medium. With a legacy spanning over 250 years, Christie's is far more than just an auction house; it is a global powerhouse within the art market. Handling billions in sales annually, they serve as crucial gatekeepers, bestowing validation upon art pieces and luxury items, which profoundly impacts their market value. This raises a pertinent question: should an institution like Christie's champion AI art? In an effort to test the collector appetite for this emerging technology, Christie's held its first dedicated AI art auction. However, the results of this initial foray were mixed. Furthermore, the sale quickly sparked vocal artist protests, with many raising claims of copyright infringement related to the training models used to generate the AI art. The decision by Christie's to dip into tech's buzziest trend wasn't merely about a sale; given their over 250-year history of defining value and pedigree, it was a significant statement. Their gatekeeper status meant auctioning AI-generated works was more than just another transaction. The goal was likely to attract new buyers and signal innovation, but the immediate backlash from artists, who accuse the technology of plagiarism, suggests Christie's is walking an existential tightrope walk, balancing the imperative for forward-thinking innovation with the need to protect its hard-won credibility and status as a trusted arbiter of value in the traditional art market.",
