  "context": "Sometimes companies face an **authenticity paradox**: the closer they get to their core promise, the harder it becomes to scale. Chipotle built its brand on \"Food With Integrity,\" linking quality with human preparation. Now, robots promise efficiency but risk eroding that perceived authenticity. The nuance here is that Chipotle must manage customer perception, not just food quality. *It's betting customers care more about speed and price than the hands that assemble their burrito.* This is like a local coffee shop becoming Starbucks: efficient, but losing its soul."
