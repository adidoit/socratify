    "happyPath": "Dick's Sporting Goods is pursuing a distinct strategy compared to many of its retail counterparts. While most retailers are shrinking their physical footprints, Dick's is building large, immersive \"playground-like stores,\" specifically its 'House of Sport' concept, in a bet to make its locations destinations. This major US retailer, boasting approximately $13 billion in annual revenue across over 700 stores and selling athletic gear, apparel, and footwear, is integrating interactive elements into these expansive new stores. The 'House of Sport' locations are notably large, described as being around 140,000 square feet or over 120,000 square feet, featuring interactive zones like climbing walls, batting cages, and potentially even an ice rink. This approach transforms the act of shopping into an activity. The decision to invest heavily in these large, experiential stores stands in stark contrast to the general retail trend of reducing store sizes. This trend is often driven by a desire to cut costs as shopping increasingly moves online. Building a House of Sport store is significantly more expensive, costing about $15.5 million more than a smaller format. However, the early results from these large stores show a substantial return on this investment. They are capable of generating significantly higher sales, bringing in roughly $35 million in first-year sales, compared to about $14 million at smaller stores. This substantial difference suggests that the \"expe",

  "context": "**Confirmation bias** means we favor information confirming our existing beliefs. Dick's loves its new 'House of Sport' stores, so they might only notice customers raving about climbing walls and batting cages. The nuance here is that Dick's might downplay data showing customers still prefer online shopping's sheer convenience. This could lead to overinvesting in costly experiences few truly value. *What's counterintuitive is that the more Dick's loves its idea, the less objectively it can see its flaws.* Like cheering so loudly you miss the other team scoring."
