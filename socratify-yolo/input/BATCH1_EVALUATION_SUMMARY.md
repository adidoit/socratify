- **Applied relevance** of mental models to business scenarios was critical
- **Unique insights** from non-obvious models elevated exercise quality

   - Provide better strategic scaffolding
   - Avoid basic/surface-level analysis

3. **Prioritize Exercise Types**:
   - Emphasize "define_success," "options," and "trade_off" exercises
   - Reduce reliance on basic "response" and "questions" exercises
   - Develop more sophisticated "contrarian" perspectives

4. **Mental Model Selection**:
   - Choose non-obvious but highly relevant models
   - Ensure clear application to business scenario
   - Avoid generic/overused frameworks

### Story-Specific Insights:
- **High-variance stories** (amazon-prime-video-creators, amazon-india-quick-commerce) need better quality control
