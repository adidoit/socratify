      }
    ]
  },
  "context": "Many companies chase **economies of scale**, aiming to lower costs by growing bigger. Trader Joe's flips this, embracing **diseconomies of scale**. They operate fewer stores, carry fewer items, and forgo ad revenue to maintain a unique, human experience. This refusal to scale like rivals creates an atmosphere shoppers can't find anywhere else. The nuance here is that sometimes, *being deliberately small is the biggest competitive advantage of all*. It's like a tiny, perfect bakery thriving next to a giant supermarket."
