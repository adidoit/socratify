    "happyPath": "The Overwatch esports scene soldiers on despite declining viewership, spurred by the 2024 restructuring after the Overwatch League's (OWL) shutdown. Recent reports reveal that though the introduction and expansion of the Overwatch Champions Series (OWCS) has revitalised the esports scene, 2025 has continued its downward trend. Overwatch 2 adds new Perks gameplay to OWCS. Overwatch 2 announces new collaboration with K-pop group LE SSERAFIM. Overwatch Champions Series expands into China for 2025 season. Reports on Esports Charts indicate a slow start for 2025. There have been eight tournaments held so far, with a peak viewership of nearly 150,000 fans for Crazy Raccoon Cup Five. The 2025 OWCS regional qualifiers have been taking place recently. The highest peak viewership can be seen in Korea Stage One, which attracted nearly 70,000 viewers. The match has also contributed to nearly half of 2025’s $65,000 total prize pool so far. Interest in the esports scene has waned since its last peak in 2023, when Overwatch 2 was first released. Over 100 tournaments were held that year, with a peak viewership of over 300,000 for the Overwatch World Cup 2023. Despite this peak, OWL viewership in 2023 was nearly half of what it was compared to early 2022. Lower viewership was blamed on Blizzard’s mismanagement of the esports scene, including moving the streams to YouTube and not teams not earning what they were promised. The Overwatch esports scene is at a critical juncture, facing persistent viewership decline and the shadow of the Overwatch League's (OWL) spectacular failure. Despite efforts to restructure with the Overwatch Champions Series (OWCS) and integrate into major events like the Esports World Cup, fundamental issues persist. Activision Blizzard must strategically re-evaluate its approach to competitive gaming, balancing aspirations for a global phenomenon with the practical realities of fan engagement and financial sustainability, all while a shrinking fanbase and new competitors like Marvel Rivals present ongoing challenges. One crucial analytical thread involves learning from past failures and parallel successes. The stark contrast between the Overwatch League's (OWL) costly, globally ambitious, and ultimately failed model (e.g., $20M entry fees, expensive international travel) and the Call of Duty League's (CDL) more contained, North America-focused, and financially sustainable approach offers invaluable lessons. Strategic questions should probe precisely what \"good decisions\" from CDL were direct responses to OWL's \"failures\" and how those lessons are being rigorously applied to the OWCS, especially as it considers global expansion into markets like China. This includes scrutinizing cost structures, revenue sharing, player welfare, and the realistic market size and engagement levels for specific regions, rather than assuming a global audience. A second vital perspective is defining and leveraging Overwatch's unique value proposition in a competitive and evolving esports landscape. The article notes CDL's success in doubling down on its \"military power fantasy.\" For Overwatch, this requires identifying its own core competitive identity that genuinely differentiates it from rivals like Marvel Rivals. Strategic inquiry must focus on what aspects of Overwatch's gameplay – its diverse hero roster, unique abilities, team-based objectives, or artistic style – create an authentic and compelling viewing and playing experience that can be uniquely amplified. Questions should explore how new initiatives like \"Perks gameplay\" or K-pop collaborations either reinforce or dilute this core competitive appeal, ensuring they resonate deeply with the existing and potential competitive fanbase rather than merely attracting transient interest. Finally, a focus on sustainable fan engagement and community building is paramount. The narrative highlights that even viewership spikes (like the 2023 World Cup) didn't prevent overall decline, partly due to \"Blizzard's mismanagement\" and slow content updates. This suggests a need to move beyond episodic event-driven boosts to fostering long-term, organic community health. Strategic questions should center on how OWCS can convert event viewership into sustained loyalty and engagement, and how Blizzard can foster a dynamic development cycle that keeps the competitive meta fresh and responsive to player feedback. This means examining metrics beyond peak concurrent viewers, like average watch time, player retention, and active community participation, to ensure that the \"new life\" breathed into the scene is genuinely sustainable and not just another short-term spike. Approaching Overwatch's esports challenges requires a multi-faceted strategic lens. By rigorously scrutinizing past failures, clearly defining and amplifying the game's unique competitive identity, and prioritizing sustainable, long-term fan engagement over ephemeral spikes, Blizzard can formulate truly impactful questions. This comprehensive approach helps move beyond merely reacting to declining numbers, enabling a proactive strategy that fosters a resilient and thriving esports ecosystem for Overwatch, showcasing how complex business scenarios demand multi-dimensional strategic thinking to identify underlying issues and forge a viable path forward.",
