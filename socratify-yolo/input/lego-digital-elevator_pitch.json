    "happyPath": "LEGO, the world's leading toymaker with over $9 billion in revenue, faces a significant challenge: children now spend dramatically more time engaging with screens than with physical toys. This presents a stark reality for a company historically built entirely on the foundation of its physical bricks. Founded in Denmark in 1958 and famous for its unique interlocking brick system, LEGO is grappling with a digital shift that requires a fundamental evolution. Despite facing near-bankruptcy in 2003 and successfully rebuilding its business around creative physical play, the current digital landscape demands a new leap forward for the giant. Recognizing this profound change, LEGO is embarking on a major digital push. A key part of this strategy involves partnering with Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, with the aim of creating engaging online experiences for kids. This move directly addresses the challenging reality that children now spend hours daily on screens, far exceeding the time dedicated to traditional toys, which significantly impacts LEGO's future relevance.
