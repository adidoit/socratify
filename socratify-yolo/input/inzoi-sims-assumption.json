    "happyPath": "Krafton, the publisher known for the global battle royale phenomenon *PUBG*, is making a notable pivot by entering the life simulation genre with its new game, *InZOI*. This move directly challenges *The Sims*, Electronic Arts' long-standing franchise that has dominated the casual life-sim market for over two decades, achieving impressive sales of over 200 million copies. *InZOI* aims to compete with *The Sims* primarily through striking visual fidelity. Developed using the cutting-edge Unreal Engine 5, the game boasts ultra-realistic graphics, potentially augmented by unique K-culture features. Krafton appears to be banking on this niche visual appeal to make its mark against an established leader with massive reach. However, this focus on high-fidelity graphics introduces a significant barrier to entry. Achieving this level of realism requires powerful and expensive PCs, a stark contrast to the relatively accessible hardware requirements of *The Sims*. This necessity for high-end machines creates an immediate limitation, potentially excluding a large segment of the potential market that *The Sims* comfortably reaches. This strategy is described as \"High-Barrier Differentiation\"—building something technically demanding and exclusive to stand out. The inherent gamble for Krafton is whether this visually exclusive approach, combined with their relative inexperience in the life simulation genre and the lack of extensive content compared to *The Sims*, can over.",
