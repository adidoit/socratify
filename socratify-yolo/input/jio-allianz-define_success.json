  "context": "Starting a business from scratch means facing the **liability of newness**. New ventures often struggle because they lack established routines and face uncertainties. For Jio and Allianz, building an insurance operation in India demands they rapidly establish credibility with regulators, partners, and customers. The nuance here is that their brand-new systems and processes could suffer from unexpected glitches. _What's counterintuitive is that rapid scaling exposes these vulnerabilities faster, potentially damaging their reputation before they even gain traction._ It's like launching a rocket that was only designed for a test flight."
