    "happyPath": "Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Financial Services is expanding its financial footprint in India by forming new insurance ventures with Allianz SE, including a 50-50 reinsurance partnership. This strategic move aims to tap into India's largely under-penetrated insurance market, which currently stands at just 3.7% of GDP. The challenge for the joint venture lies in understanding and overcoming the deep-rooted barriers to insurance adoption in a diverse and complex market, making data crucial for their success. The exercise is framed from the perspective of Allianz SE's Head of Market Research for India, tasked with identifying critical information needed about past performance to ensure the new venture with Jio succeeds, especially given Allianz's previous sale of holdings in a venture with Bajaj Finserv. Key data considerations include the specific challenges that led to Allianz's prior divestment, the customer acquisition costs of other Indian insurers, the effectiveness of various sales channels used by competitors, and market share trends among top Indian insurers over the past decade. Understanding these elements will guide strategic decisions on product design, marketing, distribution, and overall market approach to navigate the complexities of the Indian insurance landscape and avoid past mistakes.",

  "context": "New ventures often stumble on **confirmation bias**—seeking data that supports initial beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence. Allianz might only look for information that validates their Jio partnership, overlooking red flags from their previous venture in India. The nuance here is recognizing what data truly matters. *What’s counterintuitive is that the most valuable insights often come from the information we actively avoid.* It's like reading only five-star reviews while ignoring the one-star warnings."
