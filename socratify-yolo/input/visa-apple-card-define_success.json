    "backgroundNeeded": "Remember that Visa is a payment network and Apple Card is a credit card product, understand the concepts of transaction volume, return on investment, market share, and competitive exclusion in the context of business deals, and apply strategic thinking to evaluate the justification for a significant upfront payment.",
    "happyPath": "The Apple Card network deal represents more than just processing transactions; it's a strategic play for future dominance in Apple's expanding financial ecosystem. Visa's $100 million bid should be justified by defining success not just on immediate payment volume increase, but on securing a foundational role in Apple's future financial services, leading to substantial long-term market share gains and effectively excluding competitors like Mastercard from a critical platform. Success means achieving early ROI within three years through increased transaction fees and potential data insights, while fundamentally shifting the competitive landscape in co-branded credit cards and ensuring Mastercard cannot easily re-enter Apple's orbit.",
