    "happyPath": "Farfetch's online luxury marketplace collapsed from a $23 billion valuation due to a fundamental conflict between its pursuit of mass digital scale and luxury's inherent need for exclusivity and brand control. This situation highlights the complex challenge of digitally transforming industries where value is derived from scarcity rather than broad access. The core strategic dilemma involves finding alternative online models that can achieve global reach while preserving the unique allure of high-end brands. Farfetch, which at one point boasted a striking valuation of $23 billion, recently found itself in a precarious situation requiring a bailout. This dramatic turn was largely attributed to its ambitious online marketplace strategy, which inadvertently diluted the core appeal of luxury by seeking extensive scale. The difficulty in successfully selling exclusivity online and the potential for chasing scale to backfire for high-end brands are central themes in Farfetch's story. Its journey saw the company rapidly ascend to a $23 billion valuation, only to face collapse and the need for rescue just two years later. Farfetch's initial vision was to act as the premier online link connecting over 1,400 luxury boutiques with a global customer base. Its subsequent spectacular collapse starkly highlighted the inherent challenge of balancing the need for digital scale with the exclusive allure that defines luxury goods. Farfetch attempted to bridge this gap through aggressive growth strategies, including acquisitions and expanding its marketplace offerings, while simultaneously trying to maintain a luxury image. This approach, however, created a fundamental conflict. Luxury is built upon principles of scarcity, tight control over brand image, and a cultivated sense of exclusivity. In contrast, digital marketplaces typically succeed by offering mass scale, endless choice, and broad, easy access to a wide range of products, much like platforms such as Amazon or eBay where",

  "context": "Sometimes, what seems like a strength becomes a trap. That's **capability trap**: excelling at what you already do, even as the world shifts. Farfetch focused on scaling its existing marketplace model.
