    "happyPath": "Zomato's current strategic maneuver presents a classic business challenge: how does a market leader with an unprofitable core business successfully diversify into new, equally competitive, and cash-intensive ventures? The \"Zomato puzzle\" is not merely about past decisions, but about the ongoing, data-driven management required to make these risky bets pay off and reassure skeptical investors. Navigating this requires a multifaceted analytical approach. One key strategic lens is the ecosystem value proposition and customer behavior. Zomato's stated goal is to build a \"comprehensive 'going-out' ecosystem.\" This implies a belief that users will value the integrated convenience, leading to higher engagement, retention, and ultimately, a greater Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV). To validate this, Zomato needs data on user journeys across services, cross-platform usage frequency, and the incremental revenue generated by users who adopt multiple Zomato services versus those who stick to one. Understanding how users perceive the value of this integration versus fragmented offerings from competitors is paramount. If cross-platform synergies don't materialize, the diversification could simply be a costly sprawl. Another critical perspective centers on unit economics and the path to profitability for each new segment. The core food delivery business struggles with profit, and new ventures like Blinkit \"continue to bleed money.\" Strategic analysis must delve into the granular financial details of each service line. This includes understanding the precise delivery cost breakdown for grocery vs. food orders, item-level margins for various products (groceries, event tickets), and the average order value across different services. The most vital data for investors would be projected break-even points for each new venture, demonstrating a clear timeline for when these investments will begin contributing positively to the bottom line, rather than draining capital. Without a clear path to positive unit economics, aggressive expansion is unsustainable. Finally, the competitive landscape and operational efficiency are crucial. The 10-minute grocery space, specifically, is highly competitive, with rivals like Swiggy Instamart battling for market share. Zomato needs real-time data on competitor pricing models, service reliability, and customer churn to identify weaknesses and differentiate Blinkit. Simultaneously, optimizing internal operations across diverse service types is vital. Data on delivery time variance, rider utilization rates, and order fulfillment accuracy will directly impact profitability and customer satisfaction. The operational integration of food, grocery, and events must achieve economies of scale and scope, rather than adding complexity and cost. In conclusion, Zomato's ",
