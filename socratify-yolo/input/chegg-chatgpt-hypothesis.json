    "happyPath": "Chegg's dramatic decline, from an $8 billion valuation to a state of existential threat, serves as a stark illustration of the brutal speed of technological commoditization. While the immediate trigger—free AI—is clear, the *magnitude* and *speed* of the value evaporation invite a deeper analysis into why Chegg was so acutely vulnerable, and what broader lessons this holds for businesses built on easily digitized information. This scenario forces us to look beyond direct competition and consider fundamental aspects of business model defensibility. One key analytical thread is the inherent vulnerability of purely informational services. Chegg's core offering was primarily about delivering \"answers\" and solutions. Unlike services requiring complex physical infrastructure, deep human relationships, or proprietary, hard-to-replicate data, information can be copied and distributed at virtually zero marginal cost once a capable AI emerges. Chegg's perceived moat, based on its existing database and user base, proved insufficient against a general-purpose AI that could generate similar or superior answers on demand, for free. This highlights that in the digital age, a business model relying solely on information arbitrage is highly fragile. A second perspective involves the market's previous valuation and the nature of competitive moats. Investors may have overvalued Chegg's competitive position, perhaps seeing its large user base and content library as strong barriers to entry. However, as the event demonstrates, these \"moats\" were not robust against a paradigm shift in technology. The market's rapid devaluation suggests a realization that Chegg's value proposition lacked true defensibility—it wasn't rooted in unique human connection, deeply embedded proprietary data, network effects among users, or high switching costs that AI couldn't bypass. The suddenness implies that the market corrected a prior overestimation of the business's long-term sustainability. Finally, Chegg's situation also exemplifies the \"innovator's dilemma,\" where a successful incumbent finds it difficult to pivot quickly because doing so would cannibalize its highly profitable existing business. Even if Chegg foresaw the rise of AI, actively developing or shifting to AI-powered free services would have directly undermined its subscription revenue. This internal conflict often creates strategic inertia, preventing companies from proactively adapting until the disruption is overwhelming. The challenge now for Chegg is not just to find new value, but to do so while shedding a legacy model that once defined its success but now impedes its future. In synthesis, Chegg’s experience underscores that in an era of rapid technological advancement, true strategic resilience comes from building value propositions that transcend mere information delivery. Businesses must continuously assess the strength of their competitive moats against disruptive technologies, be prepared for swift market re-evaluations, and overcome the inherent challenges of pivoting away from once-lucrative core businesses. This case provides a critical lesson in understanding how quickly an $8 billion company can lose its fundamental value proposition when its core asset becomes a free commodity.",
