  "context": "Growth can create unforeseen problems. Think of **cannibalization**, where new products steal sales from existing ones. For Airbnb, pushing experiences like fancy pasta classes risks overshadowing its core business: unique local stays. What was once a differentiator—authentic, budget-friendly travel—could become a diluted brand known for expensive add-ons. *The nuance here is that success in one area can undermine the very foundation that made it possible.* It's like a band selling out and losing its original fans."
