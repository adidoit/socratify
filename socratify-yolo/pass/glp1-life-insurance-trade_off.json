  },
  "context": "Companies sometimes face a **competency trap**: sticking to what they know even when the world changes. For life insurers, decades of data analysis defined \"risk.\" Now, GLP-1 drugs are rewriting the rules. Their expertise in traditional risk models could blind them to new, unpredictable health outcomes. The challenge is that past success can become a company's biggest liability, preventing them from seeing future threats. _The most dangerous risk isn't the one you ignore; it's the one you think you understand._"
