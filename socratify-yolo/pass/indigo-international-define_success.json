    "secondaryDomainLevelDescription": "Level 3 - Informed because the exercise explicitly mentions the shift to different aircraft (Boeing 787s) and a distinct operational model, requiring an understanding of how this impacts efficiency and costs, typical of informed observers of operational practices.",
    "fileName": "indigo-international-define_success.xml",
    "backgroundNeeded": "Remember that IndiGo is known for its hyper-efficient, single-fleet domestic model and is now expanding to Europe with different aircraft, understand how operational changes impact costs and profitability, and apply strategic thinking to identify key metrics that define success for a new, more complex business venture.",
    "happyPath": "IndiGo's bold expansion into long-haul European routes, a stark departure from its highly efficient single-fleet domestic model, presents a compelling strategic challenge for defining success. The company's historical profitability and market dominance were built on operational simplicity and cost control, making this move a significant \"gamble\" that tests the very essence of its competitive advantage. The question isn't merely how to make the new routes profitable, but how to redefine \"winning\" in a way that balances growth aspirations with the preservation of its core strengths. One perspective for defining success focuses on the direct financial performance of the new European routes. Metrics such as consistently high passenger load factors, strong revenue per available seat mile (RASM) for these specific international flights, and achieving profitability within a predetermined timeframe would be key indicators. This approach prioritizes immediate return on investment, ensuring the new ventures generate sufficient revenue to cover the increased operational complexity and aircraft leasing costs. However, a narrow focus on route-specific profitability could obscure broader strategic impacts on the entire organization. A second, crucial dimension of success relates to maintaining IndiGo's operational integrity and cost advantage. Success here would mean that the introduction of a new aircraft type and distinct operational model (for the Boeing 787s) does not significantly dilute the overall company-wide Cost per Available Seat Mile (CASM). Metrics such as the continued high utilization rates of the existing A320 domestic fleet, efficient management of new maintenance and crew training costs, and the absence of any negative impact on domestic market share would indicate success in preserving the core DNA. The risk of \"complexity creep\" eroding IndiGo's foundational efficiency is a critical factor that must be actively managed and measured. Finally, success can also be defined in terms of building new capabilities and strategic optionality for the future. This view posits that the European expansion is not just about current route profitability but about developing the organizational muscle to operate a more diverse, international network. Metrics could include the speed and cost-effectiveness of adding subsequent long-haul destinations, the seamless integration of diverse operational teams and systems, and the enhancement of IndiGo's brand recognition and reputation in global markets. This definition prioritizes long-term strategic evolution, potentially accepting initial inefficiencies as necessary investments in future growth and diversification. Ultimately, defining success for IndiGo's European venture requires a multi-faceted approach that acknowledges the inherent tension between immediate financial returns, the preservation of its competitive essence, and the pursuit of future strategic capabilities. True success would likely involve achieving a delicate balance: generating reasonable profitability on the new routes without significantly eroding the overall efficiency and profitability of the domestic operation, while simultaneously building transferable capabilities that position IndiGo for sustained international growth. This holistic view understands that strategic decisions in complex environments demand success criteria that extend beyond simple profit, encompassing operational integrity, brand positioning, and long-term strategic evolution.",

  "context": "Competing on price alone creates a **race to the bottom**: profits shrink as everyone copies each other's cuts. IndiGo excelled in India by offering the lowest fares, but Europe is different. Now, competing with established airlines on complex, long-haul routes forces them to spend on service and planes, eroding their cost advantage. _The nuance here is that IndiGo is now playing a different game, with different rules, while still competing with themselves._ It's like a champion sprinter entering a marathon and expecting the same results."
