    "happyPath": "David Protein, a company highly successful with its protein bars, has made a seemingly outlandish move by launching high-priced frozen cod fillets. At first glance, this might appear to be a bizarre, attention-grabbing stunt, completely unrelated to their core business. However, a deeper strategic analysis reveals that this unconventional product launch is likely a shrewd, multi-faceted play designed to significantly strengthen the brand and reshape market perceptions. One primary strategic driver for the cod launch is to directly address and reframe the \"processed food\" critique that often targets protein bars. By introducing a natural, wild-caught product, David Protein provides a tangible counterpoint to the binary \"processed is bad, natural is good\" narrative. This allows the company to engage in an \"intellectual view\" of nutrition, shifting the conversation to what truly matters: protein density and quality, regardless of format. The billboard highlighting cod's protein-to-calorie ratio compared to their bars is a brilliant, subtle way to educate consumers and position David Protein as a leader in efficient protein delivery, not just a bar manufacturer. Furthermore, this bold move serves as a powerful innovation and differentiation strategy. In a crowded health food market, David Protein distinguishes itself not by incrementally improving bars, but by fundamentally challenging category boundaries. It signals that the company is a \"protein solutions\" provider, willing to explore diverse, even unexpected, avenues to deliver protein. The logistical complexity of shipping frozen cod also demonstrates a high level of operational capability, further solidifying its perceived competence beyond just manufacturing bars. Finally, the cod launch is a sophisticated exercise in consumer education and brand narrative control. It prompts consumers to think about what they truly value in protein – convenience, price, and taste – and challenges their preconceived notions. By offering cod, David Protein subtly reinforces that their bars, despite being \"processed,\" deliver on these core principles in an incredibly efficient way, much like the \"unprocessed\" cod. This \"riddle\" approach makes consumers active participants in deciphering the brand's message, fostering deeper engagement and trust. It expands David Protein's identity from a protein bar company to a versatile expert in meeting diverse protein needs, effectively expanding its potential market and brand loyalty. In sum, David Protein's frozen cod initiative transcends a mere publicity stunt. It's a masterclass in contrarian strategy, meticulously designed to combat brand criticism, pivot the market narrative, and signal an expansive vision for the future of protein delivery. By embracing paradox and challenging conventional wisdom, David Protein demonstrates how audacious moves can redefine market categories and solidify long-term brand leadership in unexpected ways, proving that sometimes, the strangest decisions are the most strategically brilliant.",
