    "backgroundNeeded": "Remember that CrossFit licenses its brand and workout methods to independent gyms (affiliates) for a fee, understand how platform business models can become vulnerable if the core value proposition erodes or competitors offer similar \"software\" without the license cost, and apply strategic thinking to identify the root causes of affiliate defection and prioritize the most critical questions to ask.",
    "happyPath": "CrossFit's platform model is crumbling because its affiliates, the core \"users,\" no longer see value in paying fees when they can easily replicate the workout \"software\" without the \"license.\" The key question to ask first is what specific pain points drove this departure, as this directly uncovers the erosion of value. Understanding competitor value propositions is secondary; the primary issue is CrossFit's own perceived failing. Asking about re-engagement is a later step, and while operational support failures are a component of pain points, identifying all specific frustrations is a more comprehensive first step to diagnose the core problem.",

  "context": "The **tragedy of the commons** explains how shared resources get depleted. Everyone benefits from the resource, but no one bears the full cost of its overuse. For CrossFit, its workout plans are the shared resource. Since workouts are uncopyrightable, gyms freely use them without paying the $99 fee, creating a **free-rider problem**. _The irony is that by making its product so accessible, CrossFit inadvertently devalues its own offering._ It's like offering unlimited free samples that nobody ends up buying the full product."
