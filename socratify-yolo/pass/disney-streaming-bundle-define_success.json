  "context": "Sometimes loyalty can trap you. That's **switching costs**: the hassle customers face when changing services. Disney hopes its bundled offering makes leaving too painful, but this can backfire. The nuance here is that deep discounts create weak loyalty. Subscribers stay for the price, not the content. This makes Disney vulnerable to competitors. _The more perks it adds, the less each one matters—and the easier it is to leave._ Like a restaurant offering so many discounts nobody remembers what the food tastes like."
