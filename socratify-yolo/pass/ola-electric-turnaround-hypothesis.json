  "context": "Sometimes, the initial **first-mover advantage** fades as markets mature. This happens when the early disruptor struggles to scale and solidify its initial gains. Ola Electric, despite its initial dominance, encountered hurdles in production, distribution, and service quality. This allowed established auto giants, with their robust networks and experience, to respond effectively, capturing market share. *What's often missed is that being first isn't always as important as being best in the long run.* It's like winning the first battle but losing the war."
