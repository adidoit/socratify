    "backgroundNeeded": "Remember that Ferrari's brand is built on roaring combustion engines and exclusivity, understand how translating sensory thrill to silent EVs is a key challenge for luxury brands, and apply brand strategy concepts to consider how Ferrari might maintain customer emotional connection and market position.",
    "happyPath": "Ferrari built its luxury brand on the visceral experience of roaring combustion engines, but the shift to silent electric vehicles presents a fundamental challenge. As Ferrari prepares to launch its first EV in 2025, it must redefine its core identity and \"sensory thrill\" without diluting the exclusivity and deep emotional connection that justify its market valuation. The strategic stakes involve not just product innovation, but the very soul of the brand and its unique positioning in the ultra-luxury market. A critical strategic question is how Ferrari can replicate the unique sensory thrill with electric power, as this directly addresses the core tension between its heritage and the future of performance vehicles. This requires understanding how to create new forms of exhilaration beyond engine noise, perhaps through innovative haptic feedback, unique acceleration profiles, or novel interior designs. Additionally, preserving exclusivity and customer loyalty is paramount. Ferrari's strategy of selling fewer cars than the market demands protects its desirability and pricing power. The challenge is scaling EV production without diluting scarcity, requiring careful segmentation of its affluent, repeat customers and personalized experiences that reinforce the bespoke nature of the brand. Finally, Ferrari must strategically differentiate its EVs in a competitive market, leveraging its racing heritage, design prowess, and luxury appeal to create a compelling narrative that ensures its electric vehicles are not just fast, but inherently desirable and unmistakably \"Ferrari,\" maintaining its premium valuation and insulating it from market downturns.",
