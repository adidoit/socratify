    "happyPath": "Uber's strategic pivot in autonomous vehicles marks a significant trade-off: moving from costly in-house R&D to an asset-light partnership model with rivals like Waymo. This shift immediately reduces immense financial burdens and accelerates market access for AV services. However, it introduces a profound sacrifice: relinquishing direct control over core AV technology and, more critically, exposing itself to the risk of disintermediation, where partners might eventually bypass Uber’s platform, threatening its long-term customer relationship and revenue streams. This strategic choice involves a complex interplay of gains and sacrifices across multiple dimensions. Financially, Uber is trading a massive, uncertain capital expenditure on AV R&D for a more predictable, commission-based revenue model. The immediate benefit is avoiding the multi-billion-dollar investment and inherent risks associated with developing cutting-edge autonomous technology. The sacrifice, however, is the potential for higher long-term profit margins and proprietary intellectual property that comes with owning the full AV stack. Uber is betting on the efficiency of an asset-light model, prioritizing rapid scale over deep technological ownership and its associated risks. From a control and customer relationship perspective, Uber is giving up direct oversight of the underlying AV technology and, by extension, parts of the end-to-end customer experience. While it gains immediate access to a wider range of AV services and accelerated deployment, it accepts the critical vulnerability of disintermediation. Its partners, who also possess their own customer apps, could leverage their introduction via Uber to foster direct relationships, thereby cutting Uber out of future transactions. The strategic imperative for Uber now becomes: can it offer such compelling value through its platform – convenience, aggregation, unique features – that riders remain loyal to Uber even when direct alternatives from AV partners exist? Finally, regarding competitive positioning and long-term value capture, Uber is redefining its role in the future of mobility. By foregoing the ",
