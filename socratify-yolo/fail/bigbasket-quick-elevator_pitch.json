    "backgroundNeeded": "Remember that BigBasket is an online grocer known for scheduled deliveries and new rivals offer 10-minute delivery, understand how evolving customer preferences for speed can disrupt established business models, and apply strategic thinking to evaluate the trade-offs between profitability and market relevance.",
    "happyPath": "BigBasket's profitable scheduled delivery model is threatened by rivals offering 10-minute delivery. This forces BigBasket to pivot to quick commerce, involving smaller average orders and costly dark stores, a gamble to stay relevant despite financial risks. One strategic lens is competitive necessity: ignoring the trend towards speed risks obsolescence. BigBasket's pivot is an adaptation to changing customer desires, potentially capturing younger demographics and future market share despite short-term losses. The company's existing strengths—brand recognition, customer base, and supply chain—provide a foundation to build scale and eventually achieve profitability in quick commerce, possibly by outcompeting smaller rivals. Another view is customer lifetime value: quick commerce orders can build habit and cross-sell to larger, profitable scheduled deliveries, creating a comprehensive ecosystem that serves all consumer shopping needs. Ultimately, BigBasket's pivot is a strategic imperative for long-term market leadership, a calculated risk leveraging existing strengths to adapt to new dynamics.",

        "answer": "BigBasket's reliance on scheduled deliveries, while currently profitable, blinds them to the rising demand for instant grocery.

        "type": "deep"
      }
    ]
  },
  "context": "Sometimes, seeming advantages become traps. This is **competency trap**: relying on current skills blinds you to new threats. BigBasket excels at scheduled delivery, a profitable strength. But quick commerce demands different skills, infrastructure, and culture. The nuance here is that BigBasket's very success makes adapting harder, not easier. _Investing in quick commerce feels like admitting their existing model is obsolete, even when it still makes money._ They're now caught between what they *are* good at and what they *need* to be good at."
