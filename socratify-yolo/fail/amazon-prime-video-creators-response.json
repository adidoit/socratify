This hit, however, has fueled a **creator gold rush**, leading to **escalating demands** from creators and driving rivals like Netflix to fiercely bid up prices for YouTube stars. Amazon is now facing the challenge of balancing the promise of securing ** loyal fans** through these creators against the potential risk of **sky-high costs** for such deals. Unlike other streaming services, Amazon Prime Video positions itself with a unique angle: **video not just for watching, but for shopping.** This means content isn't solely about entertainment but serves partly to **boost the value of the Prime bundle**. The goal is to use streaming content to deepen e-commerce loyalty and integrate screen time with shopping opportunities. This strategic difference informs how Amazon evaluates investments in creative talent compared to competitors focused purely on streaming subscriptions. The core strategy behind Amazon's **\"Big Creator Bet,\"** exemplified by reports of paying **$100M+ for a YouTuber** like MrBeast, is **audience transfer.** Platforms are betting that the millions of dedicated fans following stars on free social media like YouTube will transition to paid platforms like Prime Video.

  "context": "Sometimes, attracting more customers can lead to unexpected problems. That's **cannibalization**: when a new product eats into the sales of your existing ones. Amazon hopes MrBeast draws new Prime Video subscribers. But the nuance here is that many of those viewers might already be paying for Prime—just for the free shipping. *The hidden dynamic is that Amazon might be spending millions to shift existing customers from one Prime benefit to another.* It’s like paying a king's ransom to move furniture around the palace."
