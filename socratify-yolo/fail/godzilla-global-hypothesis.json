Toho defied Hollywood's dominance, making a Japanese-language film that resonated globally, even winning an Oscar. The nuance here is that Toho avoided direct competition with the Hollywood **blockbuster** machine. _What's counterintuitive is that by embracing its unique cultural identity, \"Godzilla Minus One\" found a bigger audience than it might have by trying to imitate Hollywood._ It's like opening a vegan burger joint in a steakhouse district."
