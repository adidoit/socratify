    "happyPath": "Traditional stock exchanges like the NYSE and Nasdaq, with their fixed trading hours, are an anomaly in a world of always-on global finance, where other assets like crypto and currencies trade continuously. Despite warnings about low liquidity, difficult price discovery, and complex logistical challenges for post-trade processes, these major exchanges are actively pushing to extend to 24/7 trading. This strategic pivot highlights a fundamental tension between historical market structures and the evolving demands of a globalized, digitally-driven financial landscape.",
