    "happyPath": "The financial world is witnessing a significant shift as major stock exchanges like the NYSE and Nasdaq push for 24/7 trading, following in the footsteps of crypto and bond markets. This move is widely framed as an inevitable modernization, essential for global competitiveness and greater investor accessibility. However, this seemingly progressive evolution carries profound, overlooked strategic risks. The real challenge lies in dissecting whether the pursuit of constant access might inadvertently undermine the very foundations of market integrity, efficiency, and human sustainability. One critical strategic lens involves the fundamental microstructure of markets, specifically liquidity and price discovery. Traditional trading hours, particularly the opening and closing auctions, concentrate trading volume, fostering robust liquidity and efficient price discovery. In contrast, extending trading to 24/7, especially into low-volume \"witching hours,\" risks fragmenting liquidity. This can lead to thinner order books, wider bid-ask spreads, and increased volatility, making it harder for all participants, especially retail investors, to get fair prices. Market makers, who provide liquidity, would face significantly higher capital requirements and risks due to prolonged exposure, which could translate into higher trading costs across the board. The article highlights that \"price discovery can be fraught with difficulty\" in low-liquidity environments, and such conditions force market makers to hold positions longer, increasing risk and capital needs. Another crucial dimension concerns operational resilience and systemic stability. The current breaks in trading aren't merely historical relics; they serve as vital windows for essential post-trade processes—settlement, valuation, and reconciliation of mistakes—to occur. Eliminating these pauses creates a \"logistical nightmare\" for the \"financial plumbing.\" Continuous operation demands uninterrupted system uptime, making maintenance, error correction, and robust cybersecurity far more challenging. A single glitch could ripple through a constantly active market with no downtime for resolution, potentially escalating into systemic issues. This \"always-on\" demand also places immense strain on the human capital within the financial ecosystem. Finally, considering human well-being and investor protection reveals further complexities. Constant market exposure, without the traditional \"rest\" periods, can lead to severe trader fatigue, burnout, and an increased propensity for human error, potentially undermining the quality and safety of market operations. Furthermore, while 24/7 trading offers apparent accessibility, it disproportionately favors professional investors with sophisticated tools and round-the-clock teams, exacerbating information asymmetry. Retail investors, often trading with less real-time information and in less liquid \"dark pools\" during off-hours, are more susceptible to getting \"worse price[s] than they might have done in daylight,\" raising significant concerns about investor fairness and protection. While the allure of \"always-on\" markets aligns with the broader digital transformation, this contrarian analysis reveals that traditional trading hours might have served critical, often overlooked, purposes. The strategic insights gained underscore that modernization isn't always about eliminating perceived inefficiencies, but sometimes about preserving structural advantages that ensure market health, operational stability, and equitable participation. True progress requires a holistic view that balances convenience and access with the foundational requirements for a robust and fair financial system.",

The **human costs** become someone else's problem. _The irony is that \"modernizing\" the market could create a workforce more vulnerable to burnout and errors._ It's like offering endless credit—tempting, until someone defaults."
