        "answer": "Reducing environmental impact is costly. If Zara invests heavily in sustainability while competitors don't, Zara's prices might increase, making them less competitive. The whole industry benefits from sustainability, but each individual player has little incentive to lead the charge.",

        "answer": "The model suggests that Zara needs to advocate for industry-wide standards and regulations to ensure a level playing field. Collaborative efforts with competitors, suppliers, and policymakers are crucial to overcome the collective action problem and drive meaningful change.",
        "type": "deep"
      }
    ]
  },
  "context": "Companies often face the challenge of **externalities** - costs they don't directly pay for, like pollution. Because Zara isn't fully charged for its environmental impact, it can produce clothing cheaply, even if it creates waste. The nuance here is that sustainability becomes a **public good** - everyone benefits, but no one company wants to shoulder the cost alone. _What nobody talks about is that sometimes doing the \"right thing\" can hurt your bottom line unless everyone else does it too._ It's like volunteering to clean up the park while everyone else has a picnic."
