  "context": "Banks should consider **competitive dynamics**, not just isolated moves. Stablecoins introduce a new kind of indirect competitor, outside the traditional banking system, vying for customer deposits. The nuance here is that the Genius Act lowers barriers to entry, attracting more nonbank competitors and intensifying the battle for **customer deposits**. _What's counterintuitive is that seemingly small regulatory changes can reshape the entire competitive landscape._ It's like a single drop of dye that suddenly changes the color of the whole pool."
