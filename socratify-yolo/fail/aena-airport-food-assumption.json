    "happyPath": "Aena's airline fees are capped, limiting revenue growth. To boost profits, they're heavily focusing on retail, especially gourmet food. This strategy leverages Spain's renowned food culture and a captive passenger audience to drive high-margin sales. Aena is counting on passengers being a captive audience, having few other options and thus being more likely to buy at the airport, and also on Spanish food culture making passengers willing to pay premium prices for airport food.",

      }
    ]
  },
  "context": "Sometimes growth isn't about more customers, it's about getting more value from existing ones. That's **revenue maximization**: boosting income without necessarily increasing sales volume. For **Aena**, it means squeezing more euros out of each passenger passing through their airports, especially on high-margin retail. The nuance here is understanding where passengers are a **captive audience**. _Aena isn't just selling products; they're selling convenience to a traveler who has limited options._ It's like a concert venue charging $10 for a bottle of water: same product, different context, higher price."
