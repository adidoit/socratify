    "backgroundNeeded": "Remember that banks hold customer deposits and use them to fund loans, understand how stablecoins offer a digital alternative to traditional currency, and apply strategic thinking to identify opportunities for banks to adapt to the rise of stablecoins rather than just fearing deposit outflows.",
    "happyPath": "The impending mainstream adoption of stablecoins, spurred by the Genius Act, has put traditional banks on high alert, with widespread fears of massive deposit outflows that could cripple their ability to fund loans and impact the broader economy. This perspective views stablecoins primarily as a disruptive threat. However, truly strategic organizations recognize that significant disruption often creates equally significant opportunities for those willing to reframe the challenge and proactively adapt. For banks, embracing stablecoins could mean not just mitigating risks, but fundamentally reshaping their business models for future growth and competitive advantage. One critical strategic lens is to view stablecoins as a catalyst for revenue diversification and new service lines. Rather than solely focusing on the potential loss of deposit-based net interest income, banks can explore new fee-generating activities. The article explicitly mentions opportunities for big banks to \"cash in\" by managing stablecoin reserves for issuers like Circle and Tether, or by serving as middlemen between stablecoin issuers and the traditional fiat currency world. These services represent new avenues for transactional and custodial fees, which could offset, or even exceed, some of the lost deposit revenue. Furthermore, the efficiency of stablecoins for \"quickly and cheaply make a range of payments—especially cross-border ones\" presents an opportunity for banks to modernize their payment infrastructure, attract new high-volume clients, and capture new transaction fees by providing superior payment rails. A second crucial perspective involves strategic positioning and competitive defense/offense. The article highlights how tech and retail giants like Walmart and Amazon are eyeing the stablecoin space, posing a significant competitive threat. Instead of merely reacting, banks could leverage stablecoins as a defensive and offensive tool. The consideration by \"megabanks\" to jointly launch their own stablecoin through a consortium is a prime example. By creating a bank-backed stablecoin, they could retain customers within their ecosystem, offer integrated financial services, and establish a trusted, regulated digital alternative. This proactive move not only defends against non-bank disruptors but positions banks to shape the future of digital finance, influencing regulatory frameworks and potentially capturing new market share by offering secure, compliant stablecoin solutions. Finally, strategic thinking dictates examining how stablecoins could fundamentally evolve the financial ecosystem and banks' role within it. If stablecoins indeed lead to a more efficient, interconnected financial system, banks, by adapting, could derive new forms of value. This isn't just about managing assets or processing payments; it's about becoming core infrastructure providers for a digital asset economy. Banks could develop innovative financial products built on stablecoin rails, offering more flexible lending, investment, or treasury management solutions. By actively participating in this evolution, banks can move beyond their traditional role as deposit-takers and lenders to become essential digital platforms, ensuring their long-term relevance and unlocking expanded global markets previously hampered by slow, costly legacy systems. Ultimately, the challenge stablecoins present to banks is not merely about deposit preservation, but about the imperative to strategically evolve. By shifting their focus from pure threat to potential opportunity, banks can explore new revenue streams, establish critical competitive advantages against emerging players, and proactively shape their role in a rapidly digitizing financial landscape. This multi-faceted approach, encompassing new business models, strategic defense, and ecosystem leadership, demonstrates how complex business scenarios demand an adaptive mindset that transforms perceived risks into avenues for innovation and sustained growth.",

Banks, comfortable with traditional deposits, may underestimate stablecoins' potential. This focus creates **incumbent inertia**: they react to protect their core business rather than innovate. *What's often missed is that focusing solely on deposit loss blinds banks to potential partnership opportunities with stablecoin issuers*. They could be allies, not just adversaries."
