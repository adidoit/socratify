  "context": "Diversification reduces risk, but sometimes **over-diversification** creates a new problem: \"diworsification\". That's when adding more investments actually hurts returns. BlackRock, known for its broad, diversified portfolios, faces this challenge as it cautiously enters the crypto space. The nuance here is whether BlackRock's move into capped Bitcoin ETFs enhances or dilutes their core brand promise. *What's counterintuitive is that even small allocations can signal a shift that erodes investor confidence if it's perceived as chasing trends rather than adding value.* It's like a star chef adding fast food to the menu – more options, but is it really better?"
