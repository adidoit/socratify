    "happyPath": "Banks today face a profound strategic dilemma with the rise of stablecoins. This isn't merely a technological shift; it's a potential reordering of financial flows and a challenge to their fundamental business model. Defining \"success\" in this context is complex, as it involves navigating immediate threats, seizing emerging opportunities, and collaborating with regulators to ensure broader financial stability. One critical dimension of success for traditional banks lies in their ability to defend their core deposit base and preserve their lending capacity. The article highlights a potential $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows, a figure that underscores the existential threat. Success here means not just stemming the tide of these outflows, but also actively innovating to offer competitive value propositions that prevent customers from migrating to stablecoin platforms offering higher yields, like Coinbase's 4.10% reward rate for USDC. Metrics like net deposit retention, minimizing customer churn to stablecoin alternatives, and maintaining robust lending volumes to companies and consumers would indicate success in this defensive posture. However, defining success purely defensively would be short-sighted. Big banks, in particular, recognize the \"opportunity to cash in on stablecoins.\" This points to an offensive definition of success focused on capturing new revenue streams and adapting their business models. This could involve generating revenue from managing stablecoin reserves, playing a central role as intermediaries between fiat and digital currencies, or even jointly launching their own stablecoins through consortia to compete with big tech entrants. Success in this dimension would be measured by new revenue generated from stablecoin-related services, market share in digital asset management, or the successful adoption and transaction volume of bank-backed stablecoins. This reflects a shift from just being deposit-takers to becoming key infrastructure providers in the digital economy. Finally, a holistic definition of success must incorporate the broader implications for financial stability and the regulatory environment. Concerns about uninsured deposits and potential impacts on banks' ability to lend highlight systemic risks. For regulators and banks, success would mean establishing clear, consistent regulatory frameworks (like the Genius Act) that integrate stablecoins safely without undermining the stability of the traditional financial system. This involves maintaining high insured deposit ratios, ensuring adequate systemic liquidity, and fostering a level playing field regarding capital and liquidity requirements, as Federal Financial Analytics' Karen Petrou suggests. Success here is not just about individual bank profitability but about ensuring the resilience and trust in the financial ecosystem as a whole. In conclusion, success for banks in the stablecoin era is not a single, static target but a dynamic interplay of defensive resilience, opportunistic innovation, and proactive regulatory engagement. It requires a strategic perspective that simultaneously protects legacy assets, pivots towards new digital revenue streams, and contributes to the stability of the overall financial system. True strategic insight comes from understanding how these multifaceted definitions of success interact and what trade-offs they present in a rapidly evolving market.",

The nuance here is that banks must clearly articulate and deliver on their unique strengths. They must reinforce why customers should choose lower rates in exchange for traditional banking benefits. *What’s counterintuitive is that banks need to define success in terms beyond simply matching the highest rates.* It's not just about price, it's about peace of mind."
