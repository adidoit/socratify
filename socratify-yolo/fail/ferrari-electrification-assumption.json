    "happyPath": "Ferrari's iconic status was forged upon the power and sound of screaming V12 engines, but the automotive landscape is shifting, demanding a move towards silence. This presents the brand with a significant challenge: how to reinvent its core identity for the electric era while staying true to its roots. Built on decades of roaring engines and celebrated racing victories since its founding in 1947, Ferrari has become the very definition of high-performance combustion vehicles. The pivot to silent electric power forces Ferrari to confront and potentially redefine its fundamental nature. As part of this transition, Ferrari is set to launch its first fully electric supercar in 2025. This move represents a significant break from the signature combustion engines that have historically defined the company's legacy. The task ahead involves not only reinventing core vehicle technology but also fiercely safeguarding its unique and deeply ingrained brand identity. The very thought of \"Engine Note Optional?\" strikes at the heart of Ferrari's brand. For many, thinking of Ferrari immediately brings to mind the distinctive engine roar. This powerful sound is far more than just noise; it serves as the sonic signature of decades of racing heritage and supercar excellence, cultivating extreme loyalty among enthusiasts and justifying premium price points. Now, driven by regulations and the competitive landscape, Ferrari is increasingly moving towards electric power, launching itFerrari's brand is synonymous with the loud, thrilling sound of its V12 engines. The company is now adapting to electric vehicles. Ferrari's identity relies on its roaring V12 engines. They're now building silent electric vehicles. Ferrari must redefine its appeal without that iconic sound, risking whether it can justify premium prices to loyal buyers.",
