Amazon is now facing the challenge of balancing the promise of securing loyal fans through these creators against the potential risk of sky-high costs for such deals. Unlike other streaming services, Amazon Prime Video positions itself with a unique angle: video not just for watching, but for shopping. This means content isn't solely about entertainment but serves partly to boost the value of the Prime bundle. The goal is to use streaming content to deepen e-commerce loyalty and integrate screen time with shopping opportunities. This strategic difference informs how Amazon evaluates investments in creative talent compared to competitors focused purely on streaming subscriptions. The core strategy behind Amazon's \"Big Creator Bet,\" exemplified by reports of paying $100M+ for a YouTuber like MrBeast, is audience transfer.
