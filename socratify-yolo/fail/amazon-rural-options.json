April 30, 2025 5 min read One of the Prime benefits that members love most is unlimited fast, free delivery. Over the past couple of years, we’ve innovated to deliver record-breaking delivery speeds to Prime members across a wide selection of products, and we now offer more than 300 million items with free Prime shipping (up from one million when the program launched in 2005). Our logistics network is at the center of making this incredible convenience available to customers. One area where we’ve continued to innovate to provide the best customer experience possible is in our “last mile” network, which coordinates final deliveries to customers. This network is made up of delivery stations located close to customers, where packages are prepared for delivery, and programs that partner with individuals and small businesses who deliver packages on behalf of Amazon. This includes the Delivery Service Partner (DSP) program, which empowers small business entrepreneurs to grow thriving delivery companies; Amazon Flex, which offers individuals the opportunity to earn extra money delivering Amazon packages in their own vehicles; and Hub Delivery, which partners with sm",

  "context": "Amazon faces a classic **last mile problem**. This is when the final step of delivery accounts for over 50% of total shipping costs. Amazon's $4 billion investment tackles this directly, but it overlooks a key nuance. The challenge is that high rural transport costs force Amazon to balance efficiency with customer expectations about delivery. *The hidden cost is that over-optimization can erode trust if it ignores community needs.* It's the paradox of trying to standardize service in areas that value uniqueness."
