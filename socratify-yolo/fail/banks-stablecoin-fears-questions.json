    "backgroundNeeded": "Remember that traditional banks fund loans using customer deposits and stablecoins offer an alternative place for consumers to hold money, understand how potential deposit outflows challenge this funding model, and apply strategic thinking to identify the most critical questions for adapting the business.",
    "happyPath": "The emergence of stablecoins represents a fascinating, multi-faceted challenge for traditional banks, fundamentally altering the competitive landscape and forcing a re-evaluation of long-held assumptions about their business model. This scenario requires strategic thinking that extends beyond immediate product decisions to consider systemic impacts and the evolving role of financial intermediaries. One critical strategic lens involves assessing the existential threat to the deposit-based lending model. For centuries, banks have relied on low-cost customer deposits to fund higher-yielding loans, thereby fueling economic growth. The Treasury's staggering estimate of up to $6.6 trillion in potential deposit outflows to stablecoins signals not just a shift in customer preference, but a direct challenge to this fundamental mechanism. Banks must ask: \"If a significant portion of our funding base evaporates, what alternative capital structures or revenue streams become essential to maintain our lending capacity and profitability?\" This forces consideration of wholesale funding markets, securitization, or even a pivot towards more fee-based services, fundamentally redefining their financial engineering. A second analytical thread concerns navigating regulatory paradoxes and competitive realities. The Genius Act attempts to level the playing field by prohibiting yield on stablecoins, yet non-bank issuers like Coinbase demonstrate how \"reward programs\" can effectively circumvent this. Banks considering their own stablecoins or competing with existing ones face a dilemma: How can they attract users to a digital currency without the lure of yield, especially when others appear to offer it? This prompts a deeper look into non-monetary value propositions such as trust, regulatory compliance, seamless integration with existing financial services, or superior user experience. The strategic question becomes: \"What unique, non-yield value proposition can a bank-issued stablecoin offer that genuinely resonates with users and provides a competitive edge against agile tech firms?\" Finally, the scenario highlights the Federal Reserve's pivotal role in shaping the financial ecosystem's future. The decision of whether to grant non-bank stablecoin issuers access to the Fed system is a critical policy choice that balances innovation and financial stability. Granting access could enhance efficiency and competition but might also introduce systemic risks like increased uninsured deposits or liquidity fragilities, as stablecoin issuers might not be subject to the same stringent capital and liquidity requirements as traditional banks. The strategic question for regulators is: \"How can we foster responsible innovation in digital payments while safeguarding the stability of the broader financial system and ensuring a level regulatory playing field?\" This requires a delicate balance between encouraging progress and mitigating unforeseen consequences that could ripple through the economy. In synthesis, the rise of stablecoins is not merely a product development challenge but a profound strategic inflection point for the financial industry. It compels banks to rethink their core business model, adapt their competitive strategies to an evolving regulatory environment, and influence the foundational infrastructure decisions being made by central banks. Successfully navigating this shift demands multi-dimensional thinking, recognizing that today's tactical decisions have far-reaching implications for financial stability, market structure, and the very definition of banking in the digital age.",

  "context": "Banks face a classic **hold-up problem**. Once borrowers become dependent on loans, banks can raise rates or reduce lending. But stablecoins change the game, offering borrowers alternative funding. Now banks must compete harder to attract and retain both depositors and borrowers. This dynamic creates a new form of **bargaining power**. _The nuance here is that banks must now prove their value beyond simply being the only game in town._ It's like a small-town monopoly suddenly facing competition from a global online store."
