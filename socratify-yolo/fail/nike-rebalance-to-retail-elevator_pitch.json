    "backgroundNeeded": "Remember that Nike previously shifted to a DTC model, reducing its presence in stores like Foot Locker, understand the trade-offs between DTC benefits (higher margins, customer data) and retail channel drawbacks (lost reach, partner friction), and apply strategic thinking to formulate arguments for re-engaging retail partners to a skeptical Board.",
    "happyPath": "Nike's DTC focus caused friction and slowing growth. They want to regain lost market reach. How would you pitch re-engaging crucial retail partners to a skeptical Nike Board member? Retailers provide access to vast customer segments. How would you expand on this argument to convince the Board about Nike's re-engagement plan? Re-engaging counters rivals' broader distribution. How would you develop this case to convince the Board about Nike's retail shift? A balanced model sounds wise. How would you make this case to convince the Board about Nike's channel approach? Physical stores enhance brand visibility and product discovery. How would you present this argument to convince the Board about Nike's channel change?",

The smooth flow of each river is disrupted, illustrating how conflicting channel strategies can hinder overall sales and create inefficiencies.

        "id": "mental_model_application",
        "text": "How does this model apply to Nike's situation?",
        "answer": "Nike's direct sales clashed with Foot Locker's retail efforts. This conflict resulted in Foot Locker promoting competitor brands, leading to reduced Nike sales and shelf presence. To fix this, Nike needs a strategy that prevents its direct and retail channels from competing directly.",

      {
        "id": "mental_model_insight",
        "text": "What insight does this model reveal?",
        "answer": "The model reveals that optimizing sales channels involves more than just adding new channels; it requires managing the interactions between them to prevent cannibalization and conflict. Nike must align incentives across its channels to ensure collaborative sales efforts.",
        "type": "deep"
      }
    ]
  },
  "context": "Sometimes, chasing growth in one area hurts you in another. That's **cannibalization**: when a new product steals sales from your existing ones. For Nike, its successful DTC channel directly competed with its retail partners like Foot Locker. This created channel conflict, causing retailers to deprioritize Nike and give shelf space to competitors. *The nuance here is that Nike's distribution strategy unintentionally undermined its own brand reach.* It's like a restaurant group opening a new concept next door to their original, only to see both locations suffer."
