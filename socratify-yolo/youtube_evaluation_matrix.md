# YouTube Won - Exercise Evaluation Matrix

## Story Context
YouTube dominates TV viewership by spending billions on sports rights and shifting from user-generated content to "traditional TV." This creates strategic tensions about identity, costs, and value propositions.

## Business Context Analysis
- **Core Tension**: YouTube spending $2B+ on premium content (NFL) while offering it free
- **Strategic Shift**: From "alternative to TV" to "king of TV" 
- **Key Questions**: Monetization assumptions, identity erosion, creator ecosystem impact

## Exercise Evaluations

### 1. ASSUMPTION ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (TOP TIER)
- **Goldilocks**: EXCELLENT - Clear focus on viewer behavior assumptions, multiple valid answers
- **Key Question**: "What do you think they're assuming about viewers?" (re: $2B free NFL content)
- **Strengths**: 
  - Perfect business puzzle: expensive content given away free
  - Multiple valid assumptions (ad tolerance, viewing habits, loyalty)
  - Accessible without sports industry expertise
  - Strong learning value about assumption analysis
- **Business Fidelity**: Excellent - realistic $2B investment scenario

### 2. CONTRARIAN ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (TOP TIER)
- **Goldilocks**: EXCELLENT - Strong contrarian angle with multiple valid erosion points
- **Key Question**: "What core values might this shift erode?" (TV dominance praised vs. identity loss)
- **Strengths**:
  - Perfect contrarian setup: success story vs. hidden costs
  - Multiple valid value erosions (spontaneity, creator focus, community)
  - Forces critical thinking about strategic trade-offs
  - Accessible - everyone understands YouTube's unique identity
- **Business Fidelity**: Excellent - realistic strategic identity challenges

### 3. DATA ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (STRONG)

- **Key Question**: "What data do you think they need about sports fans on YouTube?"
- **Strengths**:
  - Practical focus on ROI measurement
  - Multiple valid data needs (ad behavior, engagement, conversion)
  - Good business realism about investment justification
- **Minor Weakness**: Slightly predictable answers (ad data obviously important)

### 4. DEFINE_SUCCESS ⭐⭐⭐ (MIDDLE)
- **Goldilocks**: FAIR - Clear success focus but somewhat obvious metrics
- **Key Question**: "How would you define success for extending this TV dominance?"
- **Strengths**: Clear measurement challenge, realistic business scenario
- **Weaknesses**: Answers somewhat predictable (viewing hours, market share)

### 5. ELEVATOR_PITCH ⭐⭐⭐ (MIDDLE)
- **Goldilocks**: FAIR - Clear pitch scenario but from competitor perspective
- **Key Question**: Warner Bros. pitching collaboration with YouTube creators
- **Strengths**: Realistic competitive response scenario
- **Weaknesses**: Less direct learning about YouTube's strategy, more about competitor response

### 6. OPTIONS ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (STRONG)
- **Goldilocks**: GOOD - Clear strategic alternatives for video dominance
- **Key Question**: "What other options should they explore to achieve this?" (universal video gateway)
- **Strengths**: 
  - Multiple distinct strategic paths (super-aggregator, device integration, etc.)
  - Good strategic thinking exercise
  - Realistic expansion options
- **Minor Weakness**: Some choices could be more philosophically distinct

### 7. QUESTIONS ⭐⭐⭐ (MIDDLE)
- **Goldilocks**: FAIR - Creator retention focus but somewhat predictable
- **Key Question**: "What question would you ask about creator loyalty?"
- **Strengths**: Relevant creator ecosystem challenge
- **Weaknesses**: Answers somewhat obvious (creator needs, competitive threats)

### 8. RESPONSE ⭐⭐ (LOWER)
- **Goldilocks**: WEAK - Limited strategic depth, predictable responses
- **Key Question**: How to fight back against Netflix poaching creators
- **Weaknesses**: Obvious responses (better monetization, more support)
- **Issue**: Response exercises generally provide less strategic insight

### 9. TRADE_OFF ⭐⭐ (LOWER)
- **Goldilocks**: WEAK - Trade-off unclear, choices not distinct philosophies
- **Key Question**: "When do you think this balance makes sense?" (creator trust vs. studio control)
- **Weaknesses**: 
  - Timing question rather than strategic analysis
  - Choices are variations not philosophies
  - Less engaging than other exercise types
