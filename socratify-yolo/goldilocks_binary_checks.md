# Goldilocks Binary Checks for keyQuestionText

*Rigorous PASS/FAIL checks based on goldilocks.md principles*

## Core Understanding

The Goldilocks Zone requires questions that are:
1. **Not too open** (avoiding blue sky paralysis - "What should Netflix do?")
2. **Not too closed** (avoiding simplistic single-track - "Should Netflix raise prices?")
3. **Just right** (structured but rich - "How would you define success for Netflix's ad-supported tier?")

## Six Binary Checks

### **1. AVOIDS BLUE SKY PARALYSIS**
**Definition**: Question must provide clear constraints or focus area, not infinite possibilities.

**Test**: Does the question specify WHAT aspect to consider?

**PASS Criteria**:
- Has specific focus area (e.g., "success metrics", "customer assumptions", "timing")
- Provides clear decision context
- Constrains the problem space

**FAIL Criteria**:
- Asks "What should [company] do?" without constraints
- Completely open-ended strategy questions
- No clear starting point for discussion

**Examples**:
- FAIL: "What should Netflix do about competition?"
- FAIL: "How can Tesla improve their business?"
- PASS: "Netflix loses money on streaming. How would you define success for their ad-supported tier?"
- PASS: "Tesla insurance is 30% cheaper. Why is adoption surprisingly low?"

### **2. AVOIDS SIMPLISTIC SINGLE-TRACK**
**Definition**: Question must enable multiple valid perspectives, not binary yes/no or single obvious answer.

**Test**: Can reasonable people genuinely disagree on the answer?

**PASS Criteria**:
- Multiple valid approaches exist
- Different strategic philosophies apply
- Rich exploration possible from different angles

**FAIL Criteria**:
- Binary yes/no questions
- Single obvious answer
- Limited to one or two perspectives

**Examples**:
- FAIL: "Should Netflix raise prices?"
- FAIL: "Is Tesla's insurance strategy good?"
- PASS: "Should Netflix measure success by ad revenue growth or premium subscriber retention?"
- PASS: "When would sacrificing customer goodwill make sense for this $4B gain?"

### **3. PREVENTS CURSE OF KNOWLEDGE**
**Definition**: Question must be accessible without insider knowledge or industry expertise.

**Test**: Would a smart college graduate understand this immediately?

**PASS Criteria**:
- No undefined acronyms (CAC, LTV, SaaS, B2B)
- Uses universal business concepts
- Industry terms explained in context
- Relies on common experiences

**FAIL Criteria**:
- Uses unexplained jargon
- Assumes industry-specific knowledge
- Requires >2 years experience to understand

**Examples**:
- FAIL: "How should they optimize CAC/LTV ratios?"
- FAIL: "What's their GTM strategy for B2B SaaS?"
- PASS: "Warby Parker spends $50 to get customers who spend $200. When does this work?"
- PASS: "Amazon offers same-day delivery where labor is cheap. How might they profit when delivery costs more than shipping fees?"

### **4. AVOIDS DOMINANT ANSWER TRAP**
**Definition**: Context must not make one answer obviously correct, enabling genuine debate.

**Test**: Does the setup point to multiple equally plausible explanations?

**PASS Criteria**:
- Context creates genuine puzzle
- Multiple explanations equally valid
- Answer not embedded in setup
- Reasonable people would debate

**FAIL Criteria**:
- Context telegraphs the answer
- One explanation clearly dominates
- Setup makes answer obvious

**Examples**:
- FAIL: Context: "Company loses money and cuts costs" → "Why might morale be low?"
- FAIL: Context: "Apple is behind in AI and needs to license technology" → "Why is AI talent leaving?"
- PASS: Context: "Tesla insurance is 30% cheaper than competitors" → "Why is adoption surprisingly low?"
- PASS: Context: "Starbucks doubles down on inviting cafés as customers seek faster options" → "What deep customer connection might skeptics be overlooking?"

### **5. ENSURES ICP ACCESSIBILITY**
**Definition**: Must serve entry-level job seekers with high motivation but low business knowledge.

**Test**: Does this help someone prepare for entry-level business interviews?

**PASS Criteria**:
- Uses universal experiences (coffee shops, streaming, shopping)
- Teaches transferable business concepts
- Builds from common knowledge
- Relevant to entry-level roles

**FAIL Criteria**:
- Requires specialized expertise
- Uses advanced business concepts
- Assumes significant work experience
- Too technical or niche

**Examples**:
- FAIL: "How should they structure their Series B convertible notes?"
- FAIL: "What regulatory arbitrage opportunities exist in cross-border fintech?"
- PASS: "Chipotle's brand relies on human-made food. They're adding robots anyway. What are they assuming?"
- PASS: "Costco charges membership fees but sells items at near-cost. How might this increase profits?"

### **6. ENABLES MOBILE DISCUSSION**
**Definition**: Must work for 5-10 minute verbal discussions on mobile devices.

**Test**: Can this sustain engaging verbal debate for 5-10 minutes?

**PASS Criteria**:
- Graspable in 30 seconds
- Under 25 words ideally
- Clear tension or puzzle
- Multiple discussion paths
- No re-reading needed

**FAIL Criteria**:
- Too complex for verbal discussion
- Requires written analysis
- Over 40 words

- PASS: "How would you define success for this balancing act?"
- PASS: "What question would you ask first?"
- PASS: "When would this trade-off make sense?"
