# Logo Collection Usage Guide

## Directory Structure

├── universities/         # University logos
└── companies/           # Company/employer logos
```

## Important Notes

1. **Business Schools vs Universities**: Business schools often have separate branding
   - Use `business_schools/` for business school specific logos
   - Use `universities/` for parent university logos
   - Example: 'Harvard Business School' logo vs 'Harvard University' logo

2. **File Naming**: Files are named with underscores replacing spaces
   - Example: `Harvard_Business_School.png`

3. **Duplicates**: This collection has been deduplicated
   - Each logo appears only once
   - Highest quality version was kept

4. **Updates**: To add new logos, ensure they don't duplicate existing ones
