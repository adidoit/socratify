# The Goldilocks Zone: Complete Guide to Mobile Case Questions by Exercise Type

_Designed for motivated learners with limited industry knowledge applying to entry-level business roles_

## Exercise Type Integration

This goldilocks framework applies across all 10 exercise types in the socratify platform. Each exercise type has specific goldilocks requirements based on prompt analysis:

- **Assumption**: Must avoid binary assumptions while providing clear puzzle context
- **Contrarian**: Must balance devil's advocate positioning without obvious contrarian answers
- **Data**: Must specify decision context to avoid infinite data possibilities  
- **Define_Success**: Must provide metrics constraints while enabling multiple valid definitions
- **Elevator_Pitch**: Must establish clear pitch context and audience to avoid generic pitching
- **Hypothesis**: Must frame testable predictions without telegraphing obvious hypotheses
- **Options**: Must establish current failing approach before exploring alternatives
- **Questions**: Must specify decision context to avoid endless question possibilities
- **Response**: Must name specific responding entities to avoid abstract competitive scenarios
- **Trade_off**: Must explicitly state what is being traded off in the middle sentence

Each exercise type follows these universal goldilocks principles while addressing type-specific risks.

## Core Concept: Avoiding Two Distinct Problems

### Overly Open Questions (Blue Sky Paralysis)

**Problem**: "Where do you even start?"

- Example: "What should Netflix do?" (infinite possibilities, no direction)
- **Mobile discussion killer**: People stare at each other, don't know how to begin
- **Why it fails**: Too many valid starting points create analysis paralysis

### Overly Closed Questions (Simplistic Single-Track)

**Problem**: "There's basically one right answer"

- Example: "Should Netflix raise prices?" (binary yes/no, limited discussion)
- **Mobile discussion killer**: Conversation ends after 30 seconds
- **Why it fails**: No room for multiple valid perspectives or rich exploration

### The Goldilocks Zone (Structured but Rich)

**Sweet Spot**: Clear focus + multiple valid paths

- Example: "Netflix loses money on streaming. How would you define success for their ad-supported tier?"
- **Mobile discussion enabler**: Immediate orientation + rich exploration possibilities
- **Why it works**: Everyone knows where to start, but multiple valid directions to explore

This distinction is critical for mobile discussions where you need immediate engagement without overwhelming choice paralysis.

## Fighting the Curse of Knowledge

The #1 enemy of good case questions is assuming learners know what you know. The Goldilocks Zone explicitly fights this by:

- **Never using undefined acronyms** (not "CAC/LTV ratios" but "customer acquisition costs")
- **Always providing industry context** (not "Chipotle faces labor issues" but "Chipotle's 150% staff turnover creates hiring crisis")
- **Showing concrete impacts** (not "optimize operations" but "robots make 300 burritos/hour vs humans' 60")
- **Using universal business experiences** (everyone knows coffee shops, streaming, delivery, insurance)

### ICP-Specific Accessibility Requirements

For entry-level job seekers interested in industry but with low business knowledge:

- **Teach while testing**: Each question should introduce transferable business concepts
- **Build from common knowledge**: Start with universally understood scenarios
- **Connect to interview preparation**: Focus on frameworks useful for business job interviews
- **Avoid specialized expertise**: No questions requiring >1 year industry experience to understand

Example transformation:
Bad: "How should Chipotle optimize labor costs given industry dynamics?"
Good: "Chipotle's brand relies on human-made food. They're adding robots anyway. What do you think they're assuming?"

## Exercise Type Specific Goldilocks Requirements

### Assumption Exercises
**Goldilocks Risk**: Binary assumptions vs overly complex multi-variable scenarios
**Sweet Spot**: Clear business puzzles with 3-4 equally plausible explanations
**Example**: "Tesla insurance is 30% cheaper but adoption is low. What might they be assuming?" 

### Contrarian Exercises  
**Goldilocks Risk**: Obvious contrarian positions vs abstract devil's advocate scenarios
**Sweet Spot**: Genuine tensions where reasonable people disagree
**Example**: "Everyone celebrates Purpose-driven business. What might skeptics overlook?"

### Data Exercises
**Goldilocks Risk**: Infinite data possibilities vs narrow metrics focus
**Sweet Spot**: Clear decision context requiring specific information discovery
**Example**: "Netflix launches ads but loses subscribers. What data do they need about viewers?"

### Define_Success Exercises
**Goldilocks Risk**: Vague success concepts vs rigid single metrics
**Sweet Spot**: Multiple valid metrics frameworks for specific goals
**Example**: "How would you define success for Netflix's ad-supported tier?"

### Elevator_Pitch Exercises
**Goldilocks Risk**: Generic pitching vs overly specific scenarios
**Sweet Spot**: Clear pitch context with specific audience and stakes
**Example**: "How would you pitch Netflix's gaming investment to skeptical investors?"

### Options Exercises
**Goldilocks Risk**: Infinite strategic possibilities vs limited binary choices
**Sweet Spot**: Clear current approach failure requiring alternative paths
**Example**: "Chegg lost 90% of users to AI. Tutoring failed. What else could they try?"

### Questions Exercises
**Goldilocks Risk**: Endless question possibilities vs narrow due diligence focus  
**Sweet Spot**: Specific decision context requiring critical inquiry
**Example**: "Netflix considers cutting content spend 20%. What question would you ask first?"

### Response Exercises
**Goldilocks Risk**: Abstract competitive scenarios vs overly specific tactical responses
**Sweet Spot**: Named entities with clear strategic action-response dynamics
**Example**: "Apple blocks Meta's tracking. How do you think Meta could respond?"

### Trade_off Exercises
**Goldilocks Risk**: Unclear sacrifices vs obvious trade-off evaluations
**Sweet Spot**: Explicit trade-offs with genuine evaluation complexity
**Example**: "Tesla cuts prices 20%, losing money per car. When would this sacrifice make sense?"

### Hypothesis Exercises
**Goldilocks Risk**: Obvious predictions vs untestable speculation
**Sweet Spot**: Testable business predictions with multiple valid frameworks
**Example**: "Airbnb cuts cleaning fees. What do you think they're betting will happen?"

## Avoiding the Dominant Answer Trap

A fatal flaw in case questions is when the context makes one answer obviously correct, killing genuine debate.

### The Problem
If your context explains "Apple is behind in AI and needs to license technology," then asking "Why is AI talent leaving?" has an obvious answer - they want to work on cutting-edge projects. Discussion dies.

### The Solution: Create Genuine Puzzles

**Bad (obvious answer):**
Context: "Company X is losing money and cutting costs"
Question: "Why might employee morale be low?"
Problem: The answer is embedded in the setup

**Good (genuine puzzle):**
Context: "Tesla insurance is 30% cheaper than competitors"  
Question: "Why is adoption surprisingly low?"
Problem: This is genuinely puzzling - multiple explanations equally valid

### Testing for Dominant Answers

Before finalizing a question, ask:

1. Does the context point to one clear explanation?
2. Would reasonable people genuinely disagree on the main cause?
3. Are multiple answers equally plausible given the information?

If someone could read your context and immediately know the "right" answer, redesign the question.

- **Multiple valid answers**: Market saturation, competitive pressure, profitability needs, or network effects plateau.
- **Teaches concepts**: Introduces monetization timing and growth vs. revenue trade-offs.
- **Context scaffolding**: Would explain marketplace economics and investor expectations.

#### Example 3: "Southwest Airlines ends free bags for $4 billion profit. When would sacrificing customer goodwill make sense for this gain?"

**Why this works:**

- **Avoids extremes**: Not "Is Southwest right to charge fees?" (too constrained) or "How should airlines monetize?" (too open). Explores conditions justifying goodwill sacrifice.
- **Accessible**: Customer loyalty vs. profit trade-offs are universally relatable - no airline expertise required.
- **Mobile-friendly**: Condition exploration that works for business priorities discussion.
- **Multiple valid answers**: Financial necessity, competitive parity, customer evolution, or operational efficiency.
- **Teaches concepts**: Introduces customer equity and strategic adaptation.
- **Context scaffolding**: Would explain Southwest's culture and 50-year free bag policy.

## Key Mobile Discussion Quality Principles

### For Our ICP (Low Knowledge, High Motivation Applicants)

**Immediate Accessibility**

- Core tension graspable in 30 seconds without industry knowledge
- Uses universal business experiences (everyone knows coffee shops, streaming, insurance)
- Industry terms explained through familiar analogies, not assumed

**Mobile-Optimized Structure**

- Short setup that works in conversation
- Single clear question that doesn't require re-reading
- Multiple discussion paths from one starting point
- Easy to jump between different answer approaches

**Avoiding Curse of Knowledge**

- No insider jargon without explanation (not "AWS Bedrock," but "cloud platform competition")
- Universal concepts first, specific applications second
- Context scaffolding handles industry details, core question stays simple
- Test: Can a smart college graduate interviewing at this company engage immediately?

**Teaching Through Discovery**

- Business concepts emerge from problem-solving, not definition
- Multiple valid paths prevent "guess the right answer" feeling
- Each choice teaches something different about strategic thinking
- Builds confidence through accessible reasoning

## Zone of Proximal Development

Questions must sit exactly ONE cognitive step beyond the provided context.

**Too Easy (Below ZPD):**
"Should Southwest charge for bags?" → Binary, no thinking required

**Too Hard (Above ZPD):**
"Design Southwest's revenue optimization strategy" → Multiple complex steps

**Just Right (In ZPD):**
"Southwest ends free bags after 50 years. How could American Airlines attract angry Southwest loyalists?" → One strategic choice, multiple valid paths

## Role-Based Anchoring

Every question needs a specific perspective to ground the discussion.

**Bad (no perspective):**
"What should Amazon do about AI?"

**Good (clear role):**
"You are Amazon's Head of User Research. Your AI might disrupt shopping habits worth billions. What question would you ask first?"

**Why this works:**

- Instant context without lengthy setup
- Clear stance to argue from
- Makes abstract problems concrete
- Works perfectly for verbal debate

## Question Frameworks

### Role Assignment Structure

1. "You are [Company]'s [Executive Role]"
2. Clear situation with tension
3. Action-oriented question using proven frameworks

### Proven Question Types

**Competitive Response**: "How do you think [rival] could [action]?"

- Example: "How do you think American Airlines could attract these travelers?"

**Trade-off Timing**: "When do you think this [sacrifice] makes sense?"

- Example: "When do you think this $100M trade-off makes sense?"

**Contrarian Analysis**: "What do you think [the consensus] might be missing?"

- Example: "What do you think the consensus might be missing about McCann?"

**Success Metrics**: "How would you define success for [initiative]?"

- Example: "How would you define success for this data deal?"

**Information Priority**: "What would you [need to know/ask] first?"

- Example: "What question would you ask first about user habits?"

**Strategic Conditions**: "What would have to be true for [strategy] to work?"

- Example: "What would have to be true about their customers for this to work?"

## Choice Architecture

Exactly 4 choices representing fundamentally different strategic philosophies:

**Bad (variations):**

- Lower prices 10%
- Lower prices 20%
- Lower prices 30%
- Free trial period

**Good (philosophies):**

- Superior network (compete on quality)
- Exclusive features (compete on differentiation)
- Customer experience (compete on service)
- Targeted niche (compete on focus)

## Mobile Discussion Flow

1. **Role Assignment** (5 seconds): "You are X"
2. **Situation Grasp** (10 seconds): Company does Y, creating tension
3. **Clear Question** (5 seconds): "How/When/What would you..."
4. **Choice Selection** (10 seconds): Pick from 4 philosophically distinct options
5. **Follow-up Discussion**: "Why is [choice] the best approach?"

Total: 30 seconds to full engagement

## Testing Checklist

### The Stranger Test

Would someone with zero industry knowledge understand everything?

### The Coffee Shop Test

Would two smart people actually debate this over coffee?

### The "So What?" Test

Is the business impact crystal clear without inference?

### The Choice Differentiation Test

Do the 4 options represent fundamentally different philosophies, not variations?

### The Agency Test

Is it crystal clear WHO is deciding WHAT?

### The 30-Second Test

Can someone understand the situation and pick a stance in 30 seconds?

### The Dominant Answer Test

Does the context make one answer obviously correct? If yes, create a genuine puzzle instead.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall: Academic Questions

Bad: "Analyze strategic implications of vertical integration"
Good: "Uber might become just a middleman. Should they own charging stations or insurance?"

### Pitfall: Buzzword Soup

Bad: "How can companies leverage synergies?"
Good: "Target adds same-day delivery. What needs to be true about customers?"

### Pitfall: False Binaries

Bad: "Growth or profitability?"
Good: "Tesla insurance: lock customers or improve margins?"

### Pitfall: Kitchen Sink

Bad: "How should Netflix handle Disney+ while managing passwords and content costs?"
Good: "Netflix adds games. Why might this weaken their core value?"

### Pitfall: Insider Baseball

Bad: "Given CAC/LTV ratios..."
Good: "Warby Parker spends $50 to get customers who spend $200. When does this work?"

### Pitfall: Obvious Dominant Answer

Bad: Context: "Apple lags in AI" → Question: "Why is AI talent leaving?"
Good: Context: "Tesla insurance is cheaper" → Question: "Why is adoption low?"

The first has an obvious answer (talent wants cutting-edge work). The second creates genuine debate.
