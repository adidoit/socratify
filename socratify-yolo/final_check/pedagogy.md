## Pedagogical Guidelines

1. **Target the zone of proximal development.** Each question or task should sit one cognitive step beyond the information already provided.
2. **Build scaffolding incrementally.** Every explainer (entity, situation, mental model) must equip learners for the keyQuestion and the debate
3. **Sequence for accumulation.** Arrange elements so understanding grows logically and smoothly.
4. **Limit cognitive load.** Use concise prompts and minimal distractions, mindful of mobile users.
5. **Use established language only.** Do not coin new terms, theories, or concepts.
6. **Anchor in first‑principles reasoning.** Prompt verbal debate about mechanisms, trade‑offs, and strategy—avoid rote facts and procedures.
7. **Assume no prior factual knowledge, but moderate+ interest.** Provide the necessary context within the material. Learners are motivated individuals (seeking jobs, promotions, or career advancement) who will engage with challenging concepts through lightweight scaffolding.
8. **Never fabricate information.** Present only accurate, verifiable content.
9. **Stay relevant and purposeful.** Omit fluff, tangents, or management‑speak.
10. **Favor qualitative over quantitative drills.** Encourage comparative, directional, and causal reasoning instead of numeric answers.
11. **Maintain a friendly, welcoming tone.** Foster engagement without condescension.
12. **Write with clarity.** One idea per paragraph; avoid ambiguity, obscurity, and excessive generalization.
13. **Avoid redundancy.** Ensure each element adds fresh value and moves the learner forward.
14. **Inform, then stop.** Provide exactly the detail required—no more, no less.
