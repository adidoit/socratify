# Socratify Style Guide

## Core Principles

**Write like your reader knows nothing.** Assume intelligence, not expertise. A first-time reader should understand every sentence.

**Show, don't tell.** Replace abstractions with images. Write "Amazon delivers in one day" not "operational efficiency."

**Cut ruthlessly.** Every word must earn its place. If you can remove it without losing meaning, remove it.

**Trust your reader.** State things once, clearly. Then move on.

**Test every transition.** Each sentence must follow logically from the previous one. A stranger should see the connection.

## The Curse of Knowledge

The single biggest cause of bad writing is forgetting what it's like not to know what you know. Writers become blind to their readers' perspective.

### Symptoms of the Curse

- Using acronyms without definition
- Assuming readers know industry context
- Skipping logical steps that seem "obvious"
- Writing abstractions instead of examples

### Breaking the Curse

**Test with naive readers.** Have someone unfamiliar with the topic read your work. If they get confused, you've been cursed.

**Define before using.** When introducing any concept, assume it's new to the reader.

<example_pair>
<bad_example>"CLV optimization drives our strategy."</bad_example>
<good_example>"We focus on customer lifetime value—how much profit each customer generates over time."</good_example>
</example_pair>

**Show the steps.** What seems like one step to you might be five steps to your reader.

<example_pair>
<bad_example>"Convert prospects through the funnel."</bad_example>
<good_example>"Turn browsers into buyers: attract them with content, capture their emails, nurture with offers, close the sale."</good_example>
</example_pair>

## Classic Style

Write as if you're showing the reader something in the world. You and the reader are equals, looking at reality together.

### Principles of Classic Style

**Present truth, not persuasion.** Show readers what you see rather than arguing.

<example_pair>
<bad_example>"It's absolutely critical that companies must understand the vital importance of customer retention."</bad_example>
<good_example>"Amazon Prime members spend twice as much per year as non-members."</good_example>
</example_pair>

**Write as equals.** Don't talk down or up to readers. You're peers examining something interesting together.

<example_pair>
<bad_example>"As we all know, business is becoming more complex."</bad_example>
<good_example>"The average company now uses over 100 SaaS tools, up from 8 in 2015."</good_example>
</example_pair>

**Point to reality.** Write as if you could physically show the reader what you mean.

<example_pair>
<bad_example>"The concept of network effects creates value."</bad_example>
<good_example>"Each new Uber driver makes the service more valuable for riders."</good_example>
</example_pair>

**Avoid hedging and metacommentary.** Don't write about your writing.

<example_pair>
<bad_example>"This section will attempt to explain why Tesla might possibly be considering insurance."</bad_example>
<good_example>"Tesla launched insurance to capture more profit per customer."</good_example>
</example_pair>

## Coherence Principles

Help readers follow your logic by creating clear connections between sentences.

### Given-New Contract

Start sentences with familiar information, end with new information. This creates a natural flow.

<example_pair>
<bad_example>"A 30% increase in customer retention was achieved by Netflix. The recommendation algorithm was the key driver."</bad_example>
<good_example>"Netflix increased customer retention by 30%. Their recommendation algorithm drove this improvement."</good_example>
</example_pair>

### Topic Chains

Keep the same subject across multiple sentences when discussing one topic.

<topic_chain_example>
<good_example>"Tesla sells cars at thin margins. The company makes its real money on software upgrades. Now it's adding insurance revenue. Each new service locks customers deeper into Tesla's ecosystem."</good_example>
<bad_example>"Tesla sells cars at low margins. Software upgrades generate high profits. Insurance companies traditionally captured post-sale revenue. The ownership experience matters."</bad_example>
</topic_chain_example>

### Coherence Relations

Make logical connections between sentences explicit:

<coherence_relations>
<cause_effect>"Amazon bought Whole Foods. Now they control 500 physical stores."</cause_effect>
<contrast>"Apple designs its own chips. But it still needs Samsung for screens."</contrast>
</coherence_relations>

**Elaboration:** "Spotify loses money on podcasts. Joe Rogan alone costs them $200 million."

**Addition:** "Netflix faces Disney's challenge. Apple and Amazon also spend billions on content."

## Zombie Nouns (Nominalizations)

Avoid turning verbs into nouns. These "zombie nouns" drain life from your writing.

### Common Zombies to Kill

**"The implementation of"** → "implementing" or "implement"
- Bad: "The implementation of the new system took six months."
- Good: "Implementing the new system took six months."

**"Make a decision"** → "decide"
- Bad: "The board will make a decision next week."
- Good: "The board will decide next week."

**"Conduct an analysis"** → "analyze"
- Bad: "We need to conduct an analysis of customer behavior."
- Good: "We need to analyze customer behavior."

**"Perform an evaluation"** → "evaluate"
- Bad: "The team will perform an evaluation of the options."
- Good: "The team will evaluate the options."

### More Zombie Transformations

- "Give consideration to" → "consider"
- "Make an acquisition" → "acquire"
- "Provide assistance" → "assist"
- "Reach a conclusion" → "conclude"
- "Make an investment" → "invest"
- "Achieve reduction" → "reduce"
- "Make improvements" → "improve"
- "Have a discussion" → "discuss"

### Why Zombies Hurt

Nominalizations create wordiness and distance. They turn actions into static things.

**Zombie-filled:** "The achievement of cost reduction through the optimization of operations requires the implementation of new processes."

**Living prose:** "We need new processes to cut costs."

## Language Rules

### Replace Jargon with Plain Words

Business writing drowns in unnecessarily complex language. Use simple words that everyone knows:

- "Leverage" → "use"
- "Utilize" → "use"
- "Optimize" → "improve"
- "Implement" → "do" or "start"
- "Strategic" → delete (context usually shows this)
- "Solutions" → "tools" or "methods"
- "Ecosystem" → "market" or "industry"
- "Synergy" → "working together"
- "Core competency" → "strength"
- "Value proposition" → "benefit"
- "Best practices" → "methods that work"
- "Stakeholders" → "people involved"
- "Touch base" → "talk"
- "Deep dive" → "examine"
- "Low-hanging fruit" → "easy wins"
- "Facilitate" → "help"
- "Commence" → "start"
- "Terminate" → "end"
- "Subsequent" → "next"
- "Prior to" → "before"
- "In order to" → "to"
- "Due to the fact that" → "because"
- "At this point in time" → "now"

### Use Concrete, Visual Language

Help readers see what you mean. Abstract concepts disappear; concrete images stick.

**Bad:** "The company experienced significant growth."
**Good:** "Sales jumped from $10 million to $50 million."

**Bad:** "Market disruption occurred."
**Good:** "Netflix killed Blockbuster."

**Bad:** "Enhanced user experience."
**Good:** "Customers find what they want in two clicks instead of ten."

**Bad:** "Operational challenges emerged."
**Good:** "Planes sat on runways for hours."

**Bad:** "The initiative yielded positive outcomes."
**Good:** "The program cut waiting times by half."

### Use Specific Language

Replace vague descriptions with concrete details that readers can visualize.

**Vague:** "Tesla expanded into adjacent markets."
**Specific:** "Tesla sells car insurance directly to its drivers."

**Vague:** "Walmart has valuable customer data."
**Specific:** "Walmart tracks what millions of Americans buy each week."

**Vague:** "Spotify made significant investments in audio content."
**Specific:** "Spotify spent $1 billion buying podcast companies like Gimlet and Anchor."

**Vague:** "Netflix experienced subscriber challenges."
**Specific:** "Netflix lost 200,000 subscribers in Q1 2022—its first loss in a decade."

**Vague:** "Amazon entered the AI space through partnerships."
**Specific:** "Amazon invested $4 billion in Anthropic for access to Claude."

### Choose Simple Over Complex

Readers process simple words faster. Choose the shortest, clearest option:

- "Purchase" → "buy"
- "Approximately" → "about"
- "Demonstrate" → "show"
- "Eliminate" → "cut" or "remove"
- "Equivalent" → "equal"
- "Regarding" → "about"
- "Concerning" → "about"
- "Numerous" → "many"
- "Additional" → "more"
- "Assist" → "help"

### Avoid Predictable Combinations

LLMs tend to generate the most statistically likely word combinations, which creates flat, unmemorable writing. Fight this by avoiding these predictable pairs:

**Never use these clichéd combinations:**
- "Significant growth" → use specific numbers ("grew from $10M to $50M")
- "Operational efficiency" → describe what actually improves ("delivers in 1 day instead of 3")
- "Strategic initiative" → name the specific action ("launched insurance division")
- "Positive outcomes" → state the actual result ("cut costs by 30%")
- "Enhanced experience" → show what changed ("checkout takes 2 clicks instead of 10")
- "Leverage synergies" → describe the specific benefit ("share warehouses between divisions")
- "Drive value" → explain the concrete impact ("earn $50 more per customer")
- "Transformative technology" → explain what it transforms ("replaces 10 cashiers with 1 kiosk")
- "Disruptive innovation" → show what it disrupts ("killed traditional taxi companies")
- "Unprecedented growth" → give the actual numbers ("fastest company to reach $1B revenue")

**Why this matters:** LLMs naturally predict common word sequences. By explicitly avoiding these combinations, you push toward more specific, concrete language that students will remember.

## Structure Rules

### Lead with Substance

Open each section with concrete facts or advice, not setup phrases.

**Bad:** "In today's competitive landscape, it's important to note that companies are increasingly leveraging data analytics to optimize their operational efficiency."
**Good:** "Companies use data to cut costs."

**Bad:** "This comprehensive analysis will examine the various factors that contribute to..."
**Good:** "Three factors drive Tesla's insurance strategy."

### Craft Each Sentence Individually

Focus on making every sentence work perfectly on its own. Clear sentence structure creates clear thinking.

### Use Right-Branching Sentences

Put the main clause first, then add details. This matches how readers process information.

**Good:** "Tesla launched insurance to capture customer revenue throughout ownership."
**Bad:** "To capture customer revenue that traditionally went to third parties throughout the ownership cycle, Tesla launched insurance."

**Good:** "Amazon gained speed in AI development by partnering with Anthropic."
**Bad:** "By partnering with Anthropic instead of developing everything in-house, Amazon gained speed in AI development."

### Follow Subject-Verb-Object Order

Keep the core sentence structure simple and direct.

**Good:** "Tesla [subject] launched [verb] insurance [object]."
**Bad:** "Insurance [object] was launched [passive verb] by Tesla [subject]."

**Good:** "Amazon [subject] controls [verb] the supply chain [object]."
**Bad:** "The supply chain [object] is controlled [passive verb] by Amazon [subject]."

### One Idea per Sentence

Break complex thoughts into digestible pieces. Each sentence should complete one thought before moving to the next.

**Bad:** "Tesla launched insurance to capture more revenue from customers while also reducing their dependence on third-party insurers, which creates a vertical integration strategy that competitors like Ford and GM are now considering."
**Good:** "Tesla launched insurance to capture more customer revenue. This move cuts out third-party insurers. Ford and GM are watching closely."

### Use Active Voice

Active voice creates shorter, clearer sentences.

**Bad:** "Insurance was launched by Tesla."
**Good:** "Tesla launched insurance."

**Bad:** "A decision was made by the board."
**Good:** "The board decided."

**Bad:** "Mistakes were made."
**Good:** "We made mistakes."

### Never Use Sentence Fragments

Every sentence must be complete with a subject and verb. Fragments confuse readers and waste space.

**Bad:** "Costly for drivers."
**Good:** "Drivers lose money on suburban routes."

**Bad:** "A risky bet."
**Good:** "This strategy risks billions."

**Bad:** "Higher margins expected."
**Good:** "Management expects higher margins."

### Make Agency Crystal Clear

Always make it obvious WHO is doing WHAT. Put the real decision-maker as the subject.

**Bad:** "48 states refuse all screens in stores." (States don't make retail decisions)
**Good:** "Trader Joe's bans screens from all 540 stores."

**Bad:** "50 cities ban Uber drivers." (Sounds like cities banned them)
**Good:** "Uber stops serving 50 cities."

**Bad:** "15 million users lose Netflix access." (Sounds like Netflix cut them off)
**Good:** "Netflix loses 15 million subscribers."

**Bad:** "100 stores refuse self-checkout." (Stores don't decide)
**Good:** "Kroger removes self-checkout from 100 stores."

### Choose Strong Verbs

Replace weak verb + adverb combinations with single strong verbs.

**Bad:** "Tesla moved quickly into insurance."
**Good:** "Tesla jumped into insurance."

**Bad:** "Sales increased rapidly."
**Good:** "Sales soared."

**Bad:** "The CEO spoke angrily."
**Good:** "The CEO erupted."

### Vary Sentence Length and Structure

Mix short and medium sentences to create rhythm. Avoid long, complex structures. But equally important: vary how sentences begin and flow.

**Good variation:** "Tesla launched insurance. The move surprised analysts. It captures revenue that previously went to other companies."

**Bad (monotonous):** "Tesla's launch of insurance, which surprised analysts who had been tracking the company's various revenue diversification efforts, represents a strategic move to capture revenue streams that had previously been flowing to other companies in the insurance industry."

### Vary Sentence Openings

Don't start every sentence the same way. Mix subjects, transitions, and structures.

**Bad (repetitive structure):**
"Amazon acquired Whole Foods. Amazon needed physical locations. Amazon wanted grocery data. Amazon aims to dominate retail."

**Good (varied openings):**
"Amazon acquired Whole Foods. The 500 stores gave them instant grocery distribution. But customer data was the real prize. Now Amazon knows what you eat."

**Bad (all starting with company names):**
"Netflix raised prices. Disney launched a competitor. Warner merged with Discovery. Paramount struggles to compete."

**Good (mixed structures):**
"Netflix raised prices again. Disney's growth forced their hand. Meanwhile, Warner merged with Discovery. As for Paramount—they're still searching for a buyer."

### Make Connections Explicit

Don't force readers to infer relationships between ideas.

**Bad:** "Apple released the iPhone. Smartphones changed everything."
**Good:** "Apple released the iPhone. This phone changed how we live."

**Bad:** "Tesla launched insurance. Why are automakers doing this?"
**Good:** "Tesla launched insurance. Like Ford and GM, Tesla wants to control more customer revenue."

### Don't Force Unnatural Connections

Never create factually wrong connections just to make sentences flow. If two facts don't naturally connect, use separate sentences.

**Wrong:** "Quest headsets collect dust because Zuckerberg bets on VR replacing phones." (They collect dust DESPITE his bet, not because of it)
**Right:** "Quest headsets collect dust in millions of homes. Zuckerberg doubles down anyway, desperate to own the next platform."

**Wrong:** "Netflix raised prices because Disney launched a competitor." (Correlation, not causation)
**Right:** "Netflix raised prices. Disney's growth forced their hand."

### Define All Pronouns Clearly

Never use "this," "that," "it," or "these" without a clear antecedent. When in doubt, repeat the noun.

**Bad:** "Companies are doing this."
**Good:** "Companies are launching insurance products."

**Bad:** "This creates problems."
**Good:** "This dependency creates problems."

**Bad:** "Amazon partnered with Anthropic. It speeds development."
**Good:** "Amazon partnered with Anthropic. This partnership speeds development."

### Place Modifiers Next to What They Modify

Avoid confusion by keeping related words together.

**Bad:** "Tesla only sells insurance to drivers with good records."
**Good:** "Tesla sells insurance only to drivers with good records."

**Bad:** "Running late, the meeting was postponed."
**Good:** "Because the CEO was running late, the meeting was postponed."

### Use Parallel Structure

When comparing or grouping ideas, maintain consistent grammatical patterns.

**Good:** "Tesla sells cars, energy storage, and insurance."
**Bad:** "Tesla sells cars, provides energy storage, and is launching insurance."

**Good:** "The plan cuts costs, speeds delivery, and improves quality."
**Bad:** "The plan cuts costs, will speed delivery, and there are improvements to quality."

### Provide Essential Context

Each element should work independently. Add brief qualifying phrases when needed.

**Bad:** "Tesla is launching insurance."
**Good:** "Tesla is launching car insurance for its drivers."

**Bad:** "The strategy failed."
**Good:** "Netflix's DVD-by-mail strategy failed."

### Ignore Grammar Rules That Hurt Clarity

Split infinitives and end sentences with prepositions when it sounds natural.

**Good:** "Tesla wants to quickly expand into insurance."
**Bad:** "Tesla wants quickly to expand into insurance."

**Good:** "Amazon found a partner to work with."
**Bad:** "Amazon found a partner with whom to work."

## Elimination Rules

### Cut Filler Phrases

Delete these meaningless phrases immediately:

- "It's worth noting"
- "When done correctly"
- "At the end of the day"
- "The bottom line is"
- "Here's the kicker"
- "But wait, there's more"
- "The key insight is"
- "Moving forward"
- "In today's landscape"
- "This comprehensive approach"
- "It should be noted that"
- "What's interesting is"
- "The fact of the matter is"
- "When you really think about it"
- "To be perfectly honest"

### Remove Weak Intensifiers

These words rarely add meaning:

- "Very" (almost always)
- "Really"
- "Quite"
- "Rather"
- "Somewhat"
- "Fairly"
- "Pretty" (as in "pretty good")
- "Extremely"
- "Incredibly"
- "Absolutely"

### Delete Redundant Words

Many common phrases contain unnecessary repetition:

**Bad:** "Future plans" (plans are always future)
**Good:** "Plans"

**Bad:** "Past history" (history is always past)
**Good:** "History"

**Bad:** "Added bonus" (bonus is always added)
**Good:** "Bonus"

**Bad:** "Free gift" (gifts are always free)
**Good:** "Gift"

**Bad:** "End result" (results come at the end)
**Good:** "Result"

### Remove Unnecessary Qualifiers

Cut adjectives that don't add specific meaning:

**Bad:** "One critical reason"
**Good:** "One reason"

**Bad:** "Vital importance"
**Good:** "Importance"

**Bad:** "Serious consideration"
**Good:** "Consideration"

### Avoid Over-Qualified Negations

Don't negate before affirming.

**Bad:** "Tesla isn't just selling cars; they're building an ecosystem."
**Good:** "Tesla builds an ecosystem beyond cars."

**Bad:** "Amazon doesn't simply deliver packages; they control the entire supply chain."
**Good:** "Amazon controls the entire supply chain."

## Question Rules

### Ask Neutrally

Never hint at the answer in your question.

**Bad:** "Isn't it obvious that Tesla's strategy will succeed?"
**Good:** "Will Tesla's strategy succeed?"

**Bad:** "Don't you think customers want lower prices?"
**Good:** "Do customers want lower prices?"

### Never Ask Rhetorical Questions

Don't ask questions for drama or emphasis. State facts directly.

**Bad:** "What company doesn't want more revenue?"
**Good:** "All companies want more revenue."

**Bad:** "Who wouldn't want faster service?"
**Good:** "Everyone wants faster service."

### Make Questions Specific

Vague questions produce vague thinking.

**Bad:** "What are the implications?"
**Good:** "How will this affect Tesla's profits?"

**Bad:** "What does this mean for the industry?"
**Good:** "Will Ford and GM copy Tesla's insurance strategy?"

## Technical Writing Rules

### Explain Technical Terms Immediately

When you must use technical language, define it in the same sentence.

**Good:** "Machine learning—software that improves without programming—powers Netflix recommendations."

**Good:** "Blockchain works like a shared ledger that no single person controls."

### Use Analogies for Complex Ideas

Help readers visualize abstract concepts.

**Good:** "Blockchain works like a shared notebook. Everyone has a copy. To change one page, most people must agree."

**Good:** "APIs work like electrical outlets. Different devices plug in the same way."

**Good:** "Cloud computing is like renting office space instead of buying a building."

### Provide Context for Numbers

Raw numbers mean nothing without comparison.

**Bad:** "The company spent $50 million on R&D."
**Good:** "The company spent 10% of revenue on R&D."

**Bad:** "Tesla sold 500,000 cars."
**Good:** "Tesla sold 500,000 cars, matching BMW's annual sales."

### Ground Abstractions in Reality

Connect business concepts to real-world experiences.

**Bad:** "Customer acquisition costs increased."
**Good:** "Tesla's customer acquisition costs nearly doubled last year."

**Bad:** "Market penetration remains low."
**Good:** "Only 2% of car buyers choose electric vehicles."

## Formatting and Technical Rules

### Use Standard Punctuation

Stick to periods, commas, and semicolons. Avoid em dashes and colons in body text.

**Good:** "Tesla launched insurance. The move surprised analysts."
**Bad:** "Tesla launched insurance—a move that surprised analysts."

### Minimize Bullets and Emphasis

- Use bullet points only when they improve scanning, not as a crutch for poor organization
- **Highlight key phrases**, not complete sentences
- Avoid emojis in formal content
- Don't use bullets to list things that flow naturally in sentences

### Keep XML Clean

Write content without word counts, internal commentary, or notes within XML tags. Use separate thinking notes outside XML elements.

### Order Information Logically

Put subjects before actions. Place known information before new information.

**Good:** "Tesla launched insurance."
**Bad:** "Insurance was launched by Tesla."

**Good:** "Amazon, the retail giant, bought Whole Foods."
**Bad:** "Whole Foods was bought by Amazon, the retail giant."

### Make Every Element Earn Its Place

Delete anything that doesn't advance the argument or add new information. Every sentence must move the story forward.

### Hook with Opening Sentences

Your first sentence in any section must create curiosity or deliver immediate value.

**Bad:** "This section will discuss Tesla's strategy."
**Good:** "Tesla now sells insurance in over a dozen states."

**Bad:** "Let's explore what this means for the industry."
**Good:** "Ford and GM are scrambling to copy Tesla's model."

### Eliminate Formulaic Conclusions

Avoid predictable ending patterns.

**Bad:** "The key insight is that companies must balance speed and control."
**Good:** "Amazon chose speed. They may regret sacrificing control."

**Bad:** "Remember, the goal is not to move fast but to move smart."
**Good:** "Moving fast without control creates new problems."

### Avoid Theatrical Transitions

Skip dramatic phrases that artificially build suspense.

**Bad:** "But here's the twist that changes everything."
**Good:** "Amazon's contract includes an escape clause."

**Bad:** "What happens next will shock you."
**Good:** "Anthropic tripled its prices."

## Mobile and Scanning Rules

### Write Short Paragraphs

Keep paragraphs to 1-3 sentences. White space helps readers process information on small screens.

### Use Descriptive Headlines

Headlines should preview content, not tease it.

**Bad:** "The Surprising Truth About Tesla"
**Good:** "Tesla's Insurance Business Beats Industry Margins"

**Bad:** "What Amazon Doesn't Want You to Know"
**Good:** "Amazon's AI Partnership Costs Control"

### Design for Skimming

Readers should grasp key points at a glance. Use descriptive subheads and front-load important information.

### Front-load Information

Put the most important information first in every sentence, paragraph, and section.

**Good:** "Tesla's insurance division turned profitable last quarter, surprising analysts who expected losses."
**Bad:** "Surprising analysts who expected losses, Tesla's insurance division turned profitable last quarter."

### Balance Length and Value

Reader time investment should match the insight gained. A clear five-sentence explanation beats a brilliant hundred-sentence analysis.

### Integrate Related Ideas

Combine connected thoughts into single, efficient sentences rather than splitting them unnecessarily.

**Good:** "Tesla launched insurance to capture revenue throughout vehicle ownership."
**Bad:** "Tesla launched insurance. The goal is to capture customer revenue. This revenue spans the entire ownership period."

**Good:** "Amazon bought Whole Foods for its 500 store locations and customer data."
**Bad:** "Amazon bought Whole Foods. They wanted physical stores. They also wanted customer data."

## Final Tests

### The Stranger Test

Would someone with no background knowledge understand each sentence? If not, add context or rewrite.

### The Phone Test

Could you explain this idea clearly over the phone? If not, simplify the language and structure.

### The Coffee Shop Test

Would two smart people discussing this over coffee use your exact words? If not, use simpler, more natural language.

### The Skimming Test

Can someone scanning your text in 30 seconds understand the main point? If not, front-load key information and shorten paragraphs.

### The Single Sentence Test

Does each sentence work perfectly on its own? Can you understand it without reading what comes before or after?

### The Grammar Check

Does your grammar serve clarity? If a rule makes your writing worse, ignore it. If breaking a rule creates confusion, follow it.

### The "So What?" Test

After each sentence, ask "So what?" If the implication isn't obvious to a first-time reader, make it explicit in the next sentence.

### The Transition Test

Read each pair of consecutive sentences. Does the second sentence logically follow from the first? Would a stranger understand the connection?

### The Precision Test

Are your specific details verified and essential to the point? "Small resorts" often works better than "30 rooms or fewer" if the exact number isn't confirmed or crucial.

### The Industry Assumption Test

Would someone outside this industry understand why this matters? If you're discussing "customer acquisition costs" or "channel conflict," explain the business impact in human terms.
