AI is taking over the world by storm! This year, AI is our focus at Oktane. We want to ensure you have the tools, the know-how, and solutions to keep your software systems secure, from traditional user apps to AI agents.

We canâ€™t wait to meet you and hear about your application needs and challenges. Join us at Caesars Forum in Las Vegas, NV, on September 24-26, 2025, for [Oktane](https://www.okta.com/oktane), and letâ€™s nerd out on security, AI, and identity. Throw in a dash of fun for good measure!

We planned engaging events to help you navigate the evolving world of AI and identity. Stop by and chat with us at these activities:

# Stop by the Oktane Developer Lounge

Find our lounge in the Oktane Expo Hall, where youâ€™ll discover the ways Okta can help you create secure applications with human and non-human identities. ðŸ¤–

Learn more about securing AI with Cross App Access, and hear lightning talks about on-point security and identity topics!

Youâ€™ll also have a chance to connect with identity experts from our friends on the Developer Support teams. Do you have a question about your Okta implementation? The Developer Support team is here to help!

We want your feedback on our documentation! Visit our boothâ€™s interactive games and tell us how you learn about identity concepts. Your input will help us organize and present our docs in a clearer, more intuitive way.

Weâ€™ll also have more going on in the Developer Lounge. You wonâ€™t want to miss out on the action.

## Check out the Oktane hands-on labs for interactive learning opportunities

Roll up your sleeves and get your coding on. This is your chance to build code using Okta solutions and network with like-minded developers. [Sign up for admin and developer labs](https://www.okta.com/oktane/labs/) and save your spot for great hands-on experiences such as:

**Secure Your Enterprise AI with the new OAuth Extension Protocol Cross App Access (XAA) and Model Context Protocol (MCP)**   
Secure AI access to enterprise applications using the new OAuth Cross App Access (XAA) extension and Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Terraform 101: Automating Okta**   
Learn the basics of Terraform and get hands-on using it to manage an Okta tenant

**Use Okta Identity Governance to Replace Standing Admin Access with Time-Bound Requests**   
Get more out of Okta Identity Governance and reduce your attack surface by leveraging Workflows to enhance streamlining least privilege access for administrative permissions

**Use Possession-proof Tokens to Protect Your Apps with Okta**   
Leverage the OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) spec to add an extra protection mechanism on access tokens. This lab upgrades a Single Page Application (SPA) â€“ using an OAuth 2.0 Bearer access token â€“ into a more secure DPoP token.

## Okta Workflows community meetup

Join the [Okta Workflows community meetup](https://www.meetup.com/okta-workflows/events/310474394/) during Oktane 2025 in Las Vegas. Meet Workflows community members, colleagues, and friends over drinks and delicious appetizers.
