July 29, 2025
You might notice something different about this month’s update. We’ve dropped “The Drop” and we’re calling this what it really is: a product update. Same great content, just a clearer name that gets straight to the point.
Speaking of getting straight to the point, let’s talk about AI. If you’re building with AI models or agents, you’ve probably already noticed that AI is limited by the information it can access and understand. And even if you’re not directly integrating AI, AI models may already be calling your APIs.
That’s why this month’s product update focuses on getting your APIs ready for these new demands. We’ll walk you through resources to assess your API readiness and share practical agent templates that demonstrate real business use cases, so you can see exactly what AI agents can accomplish.
Let’s dive in.
## Build AI agents with pre-configured templates
You keep hearing about AI agents, but building them from scratch means tackling multiple challenges. After figuring out which APIs to integrate, you have to determine which endpoints to call, what data to send and retrieve, and how to tell to instruct the LLM. And once you get that working, you’re not sure if your prototype will scale and perform under real-world conditions. Without concrete examples and guidance, it’s difficult to know where to even start.
That’s why we’ve built a series of agentic AI templates with practical business applications that span from DevOps and Customer Support to Marketing and Sales, including:
* A [GitHub workflow agent](http://postman.com/templates/agents/github-issue-prioritization-agent/?utm_campaign=july-2025-product-updates&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=postman "http://postman.com/templates/agents/github-issue-prioritization-agent/?utm_campaign=july-2025-product-updates&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=postman") that reviews and categorizes issues, extracts sentiment insights, and shares prioritized updates in Slack
* A [post-incident report generator](https://www.postman.com/templates/agents/incident-management-agent/?utm_campaign=july-2025-product-updates&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=postman "https://www.postman.com/templates/agents/incident-management-agent/?utm_campaign=july-2025-product-updates&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=postman") that automatically drafts a summary, timeline, and root-cause analysis as soon as an issue is resolved
* An [intelligent routing system](http://postman.com/templates/agents/customer-ticket-triage-agent/?utm_campaign=july-2025-product-updates&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=postman "http://postman.com/templates/agents/customer-ticket-triage-agent/?utm_campaign=july-2025-product-updates&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=postman") that analyzes incoming tickets, searches your database for a solution, and responds to users to resolve common issues

We’ve released these along with [several other templates](https://www.postman.com/templates/agents/?utm_campaign=july-2025-product-updates&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=postman "https://www.postman.com/templates/agents/?utm_campaign=july-2025-product-updates&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=postman") that are pre-configured with the API endpoints you need to get started. You can fork and customize them to fit your exact environment and use case.
## Assess your API readiness
AI is transforming software development, but your APIs could be a hidden bottleneck. Unlike developers, agents can’t adapt to poor interfaces and will fail when they encounter:
* Response times over 100ms that cause timeouts
* Missing or incomplete documentation
* Inconsistent error messages
* Ambiguous field names or data formats
If your API landscape has any of these gaps, your AI efforts will stall before they even start. And if your APIs aren’t ready, even the best models won’t deliver the outcomes you need.
Even if you’re not implementing AI yourself, your APIs may already be under pressure from AI. For instance:
* Your monitoring platform that uses AI for anomaly detection could suddenly expect faster response times
* Your CI/CD pipeline might embed AI code review tools that make more frequent API calls
* Third-party services you integrate with might quietly add AI features that change how they interact with your endpoints
If you’re not aware of the changes, you might be debugging mysterious timeouts, unexpected load patterns, or performance issues that seem to come out of nowhere.
We’ve built a dedicated hub that diagnoses exactly where your APIs fall short of AI requirements and provides step-by-step fixes for each gap. On our [AI-Ready APIs Start with Postman](https://www.postman.com/ai/ai-ready-apis/?utm_campaign=july-2025-product-updates&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=postman "https://www.postman.com/ai/ai-ready-apis/?utm_campaign=july-2025-product-updates&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=postman") page, you’ll find resources that meet you wherever you are on your journey. Comprehensive readiness guides for both developers and leaders offer actionable steps to get your APIs ready for the demands of AI models and agents. And if you’re still weighing the impact, we’ve also unpacked what inconsistent APIs really cost, from lost engineering time to delayed outcomes and strategic risk.
## Monitor APIs in real time with zero setup
AI agents and models are only as reliable as the APIs they call, so AI observability is really API observability. When AI systems fail, it’s usually because the APIs powering them have failed. This means API monitoring is more critical than ever, but tracking down where things went wrong isn’t always a straightforward process. Digging through logs is time-consuming, and custom dashboards can be complex to set up, maintain, and interpret. Even when you uncover the error, it can be tough for teams to know where to begin.
Postman Insights provides real-time visibility into your API traffic. Install the lightweight agent at the container level, and it immediately starts monitoring your APIs without touching your codebase. Insights gives you comprehensive observability that goes beyond traditional monitoring:
* Automatically discovers API endpoints without manual setup
* Surfaces exact API calls that triggered errors
* Tracks errors, flaky endpoints, and performance trends across your APIs, including areas missed by your current monitoring tools
* Set thresholds to detect high error rates and get comprehensive alerting for your API endpoints
* Repro Mode lets you open any failing request in Postman’s Request Builder to inspect, replay, and troubleshoot errors using real user data
Sorry, your browser doesn’t support embedded videos.
We’re excited to share that Insights is now available to customers on Postman’s Free, Basic, and Professional plans for free during the introductory period. Insights is currently designed to deliver the most value for smaller teams with straightforward deployments, and we’re rolling out support in stages to ensure a high-quality experience. For now, we recommend Insights for teams that meet the following criteria:
* Deployments running on Kubernetes, ECS, EC2, or Elastic Beanstalk
* Services handling up to 8,000 requests/minute per instance
Check out the [Postman Insights documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/insights/get-started/overview/?utm_campaign=july-2025-product-updates&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=postman "https://learning.postman.com/docs/insights/get-started/overview/?utm_campaign=july-2025-product-updates&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=postman") to learn more and get started.
## Collaborate on Postman Notebooks with comments and reactions
You find lots of great API projects and tutorials on the Postman API Network, but when you want to give feedback to creators, there’s no straightforward way to do it. You might have questions about implementation details, suggestions for improvements, or just want to acknowledge their clever solutions. This communication gap makes it harder for creators to improve their content and for the community to build on each other’s work.
Postman Notebooks now include comments and reactions, giving you a direct way to communicate with creators and collaborate on API projects:
* Comment on any section to ask questions, suggest improvements, or share your experience
* Use reactions to quickly show appreciation for helpful content
* Create a feedback loop that helps creators refine their projects
Try it out with your own entry in the [Postman Notebook Challenge](https://www.postman.com/lp/notebookchallenge2025/?utm_campaign=july-2025-product-updates&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=postman "https://www.postman.com/lp/notebookchallenge2025/?utm_campaign=july-2025-product-updates&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=postman"), where your creativity can meet community.
