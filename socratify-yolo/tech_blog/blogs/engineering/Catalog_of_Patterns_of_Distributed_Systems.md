# Catalog of Patterns of Distributed Systems

Distributed systems provide a particular challenge to program. They often require us to have multiple copies of data, which need to keep synchronized. Yet we cannot rely on processing nodes working reliably, and network delays can easily lead to inconsistencies. Despite this, many organizations rely on a range of core distributed software handling data storage, messaging, system management, and compute capability. These systems face common problems which they solve with similar solutions.

In 2020 I began collecting these solutions as patterns, publishing them on this site as I developed them. In 2023 these were published in the book [Patterns of Distributed Systems](/books/patterns-distributed.html). On this site I now have short summaries of each pattern, with deep links to the relevant chapters for the online eBook publication on oreilly.com (marked on this page with [![](/external.svg)).](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/patterns-of-distributed/9780138222246)
