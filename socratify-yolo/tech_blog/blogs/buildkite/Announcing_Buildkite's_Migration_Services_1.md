Traditional CI/CD tools can cause frustrating problems that hold back your engineering team. Slow builds, configuration headaches, and scaling constraints have become an accepted part of the development workflow, but they don’t have to be.
We’ve seen hundreds of teams achieve dramatic improvements in their CI/CD performance by moving to Buildkite, and our expert team has helped many of them through successful migrations.
Today, we're excited to announce [Buildkite’s Migration Services](https://buildkite.com/resources/migrations/) — a specialized team that offers hands-on support and deep expertise to help you successfully move from Jenkins, CircleCI, Github Actions or other CI/CD platforms to Buildkite. This new service is specifically designed to make your transition smooth, efficient, and tailored to your organization's unique needs.
### What makes our approach different?
Every platform has unique patterns and workarounds that teams have built over time. Simply converting configurations without understanding these nuances often recreates the same problems on a new platform.
Our approach is to make targeted recommendations for performance improvements using Buildkite's architecture, ensuring you get maximum performance gains from day one.
Our team will work with yours to translate your custom build scripts, deployment processes, and third-party integrations, and even create custom plugins or helper scripts when needed. We work with your existing setup and deliver Buildkite-ready configurations without requiring access to your infrastructure (although repository access does help us move faster).
Our straightforward process is designed to move as quickly as your team would like. We offer step-by-step assistance to help you switch with confidence:
1.**Discovery Call:**Comprehensive walkthrough of your current CI/CD setup to understand your unique environment, pain points, and migration goals.
2.**Proposal:**Scope document with cost proposal with timelines tailored to your specific migration complexity.
3.**Direct Line to Support:**Dedicated Slack channel for direct access to our migration experts throughout the project.
4.**Pipeline Translation & Architecture Guidance:**Optimize existing pipelines for Buildkite while providing architecture recommendations for peak performance.
5.**Implementation & Iteration :**Ongoing support through live sessions and async communication until your pipelines are running smoothly.
6.**Completion & Long-term Support:**Premium support is required along side Migration Services to ensure continued peak performance.
### Flexible migration options
We understand that every team has different migration needs and preferences. Whether you want full-service support or prefer a guided approach, we are set up to accommodate your needs.
**Full-Service Migration:**Complete end-to-end migration with pipeline optimization, architecture guidance, and implementation support.
**Guidance-Only:**Strategic advice and troubleshooting while your team handles implementation.
### Ready to Transform Your CI/CD Experience?

### Frequently asked questions
### How long does a typical migration take?
Migration timelines vary upon several factors. The complexity of the migration, the availability of the team, and their desired pace. Our migrations team can provide a detailed timeline after the discovery call.
### Do you need access to our infrastructure?
No infrastructure access required. We work with your existing setup and deliver Buildkite-ready configurations. While read access to repositories helps us work more efficiently, it's completely optional.
### What CI/CD platforms do you migrate from?
We migrate from all major platforms including Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, TeamCity, and others. Our team has experience with both cloud-hosted and self-managed solutions.
### Can you migrate our custom scripts and integrations?
Absolutely. We translate custom build scripts, deployment processes, and third-party integrations as part of the migration. If needed, we'll create custom plugins or helper scripts to maintain your existing workflows.
### What if we want to do the migration ourselves?
No problem. We offer guidance-only engagements where we provide advice, troubleshoot issues, and review your work. You can also start with our free self-service migration tool to explore the conversion process.
### What happens if we run into issues after migration?
We provide post-migration support to ensure everything runs smoothly. Plus, Buildkite's support team is always available to help with any questions about the platform itself.
