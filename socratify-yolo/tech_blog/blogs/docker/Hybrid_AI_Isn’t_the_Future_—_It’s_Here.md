Running large AI models in the cloud gives access to immense capabilities, but it doesn’t come for free. The bigger the models, the bigger the bills, and with them, the risk of unexpected costs.

Local models flip the equation. They safeguard privacy and keep costs predictable, but their smaller size often limits what you can achieve.

For many GenAI applications, like analyzing long documents or running workflows that need a large context, developers face a tradeoff between quality and cost. But there might be a smarter way forward: a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of remote intelligence with local efficiency.

This idea is well illustrated by [the Minions protocol](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15964), which coordinates lightweight local “minions” with a stronger remote model to achieve both cost reduction and accuracy preservation. By letting local agents handle routine tasks while deferring complex reasoning to a central intelligence, Minions demonstrates how organizations can cut costs without sacrificing quality.

With Docker and Docker Compose, the setup becomes simple, portable, and secure.

In this post, we’ll show how to use Docker Compose, Model Runner, and the MinionS protocol to deploy hybrid models and break down the results and trade-offs.

## What’s Hybrid AI

Hybrid AI combines the strengths of powerful cloud models with efficient local models, creating a balance between performance, cost, and privacy. Instead of choosing between quality and affordability, Hybrid AI workflows let developers get the best of both worlds.

Next, let’s see an example of how this can be implemented in practice.

#### The Hybrid Model: Supervisors and Minions

Think of it as a teamwork model:

***Remote Model (Supervisor)**: Smarter, more capable, but expensive. It doesn’t do all the heavy lifting, it directs the workflow.
***Local Models (Minions)**: Lightweight and inexpensive. They handle the bulk of the work in parallel, following the supervisor’s instructions.

Here’s how it plays out in practice in our new Dockerized Minions integration:

1. Spin up the Minions application server with _docker compose up_
2. A request is sent to the remote model. Instead of processing all the data directly, it generates executable code that defines how to split the task into smaller jobs.
3. Execute that orchestration code inside the Minions application server, which runs in a Docker container and provides sandboxed isolation.
4. Local models run those subtasks, analyzing chunks of a large document, summarizing sections, or performing classification in parallel.
5. The results are sent back to the remote model, which aggregates them into a coherent answer.

The remote model acts like a supervisor, while the local models are the team members doing the work. The result is a division of labor that’s efficient, scalable, and cost-effective.

### Why Hybrid?

***Cost Reduction**: Local models handle most of the tokens and context, thereby reducing cloud model usage.
***Scalability**: By splitting large jobs into smaller ones, workloads scale horizontally across local models.
***Security**: The application server runs in a Docker container, and orchestration code is executed there in a sandboxed environment.
***Quality**: Hybrid protocols pair the cost savings of local execution with the coherence and higher-level reasoning of remote models, delivering better results than local-only setups.
***Developer Simplicity**: Docker Compose ties everything together into a single configuration file, with no messy environment setup.

## Research Benchmarks: Validating the Hybrid Approach

The ideas behind this hybrid architecture aren’t just theoretical, they’re backed by research. In this recent research paper [Minions: Cost-efficient Collaboration Between On-device and Cloud Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15964), the authors evaluated different ways of combining smaller local models with larger remote models.

The results demonstrate the value of the hybrid design where a local and remote model collaborate on a task:

***Minion Protocol**: A local model interacts directly with the remote model, which reduces cloud usage significantly. This setup achieves a 30.4× reduction in remote inference costs, while maintaining about 87% of the performance of relying solely on the remote model.
***MinionS Protocol**: A local model executes parallel subtasks defined by code generated by the remote model. This structured decomposition achieves a 5.7× cost reduction while preserving ~97.9% of the remote model’s performance.

This is an important validation: hybrid AI architectures can deliver nearly the same quality as high-end proprietary APIs, but at a fraction of the cost.

For developers, this means you don’t need to choose between quality and cost, you can have both. Using Docker Compose as the orchestration layer, the hybrid MinionS protocol becomes straightforward to implement in a real-world developer workflow.

## Compose-Driven Developer Experience

What makes this approach especially attractive for developers is how little configuration it actually requires.

With [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/ai/compose/models-and-compose/), setting up a local AI model doesn’t involve wrestling with dependencies, library versions, or GPU quirks. Instead, the model can be declared as a service in a few simple lines of YAML, making the setup both transparent and reproducible.

    models:
    
      worker:
    
        model: ai/llama3.2
    
        context_size: 10000

This short block is all it takes to bring up a worker running a local Llama 3.2 model with a 10k context window. Under the hood, Docker ensures that this configuration is portable across environments, so every developer runs the same setup, without ever needing to install or manage the model manually.

Please note that, depending on the environment you are running in, [Docker Model Runner](https://docs.docker.com/ai/model-runner/) might run as a host process (Docker Desktop) instead of in a container (Docker CE) to ensure optimal inference performance.

Beyond convenience, containerization adds something essential:**security**.

In a hybrid system like this, the remote model generates code to orchestrate local execution. By running that code inside a Docker container, it’s safely sandboxed from the host machine. This makes it possible to take full advantage of dynamic orchestration without opening up security risks.

The result is a workflow that feels effortless: declare the model in Compose, start it with a single command, and trust that Docker takes care of both reproducibility and isolation. Hybrid AI becomes not just powerful and cost-efficient, but also safe and developer-friendly.

You can find a complete example ready to use [here](https://github.com/docker/compose-for-agents/tree/52171991f314a9c95734f3779940bad6e48eedb8/minions). In practice, using ai/qwen3 as a local model can cut cloud usage significantly. For a typical workload, only ~15,000 remote tokens are needed, about half the amount required if everything ran on the remote model.

This reduction comes with a tradeoff: because tasks are split, orchestrated, and processed locally before aggregation, responses may take longer to generate (up to ~10× slower). For many scenarios, the savings in cost and control over data can outweigh the added latency.

### Conclusion

Hybrid AI is no longer just an interesting idea, it is a practical path forward for developers who want the power of advanced models while keeping costs low.

The research behind Minions shows that this approach can preserve nearly all the quality of large remote models while reducing cloud usage dramatically. Docker, in turn, makes the architecture simple to run, easy to reproduce, and secure by design.

By combining remote intelligence with local efficiency, and wrapping it all in a developer-friendly Compose setup, we can better control the tradeoff between capability and cost. What emerges is an AI workflow that is smarter, more sustainable, and accessible to any developer, not just those with deep infrastructure expertise.

This shows a realistic direction for GenAI: not always chasing bigger models, but finding smarter, safer, and more efficient ways to use them. By combining Docker and MinionS, developers already have the tools to experiment with this hybrid approach and start building cost-effective, reproducible AI workflows today.
