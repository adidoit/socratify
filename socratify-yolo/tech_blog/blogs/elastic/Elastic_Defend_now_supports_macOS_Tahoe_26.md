Apple macOS Tahoe 26 raises the bar on performance, usability, and security. Elastic Security is ready on day one, giving organizations the confidence to roll out new machines, upgrade existing devices, or evaluate macOS Tahoe 26 for future deployments without delay.

## Why new macOS support matters

Many security teams face a gap in endpoint visibility when employees upgrade to the newest version of macOS. If their extended endpoint detection and response (XDR) solution isn’t compatible, analysts lose critical telemetry — risking delayed detections and giving attackers a window of opportunity.

Elastic is committed to eliminating that gap. By ensuring Elastic Defend is validated for macOS Tahoe 26 before release, we help security teams maintain full coverage without interruptions as their organizations adopt Apple’s latest OS.

## What this means for you

***Full compatibility with macOS Tahoe 26:**Elastic Defend covers everything from system extension approval to system integrity monitoring.

***Consistent coverage across environments:**Elastic provides security operations center (SOC) teams with a unified view of endpoint activity across Windows, Linux, and macOS, guaranteeing comprehensive operating system coverage.

***Streamlined permissions setup:**Installing Elastic Defend on macOS Tahoe 26 now seamlessly supports the permissions workflow.

    * Approve the system extension to monitor process, file, and network-level visibility.

    * Enable network content filtering for host isolation.

    * Grant full disk access essential for deep system event monitoring.

***Enterprise-friendly deployment via mobile device management (MDM):**Deploying Elastic Defend at scale is easier than ever. macOS Tahoe 26 is fully supported through standard MDM workflows, enabling silent installation with preapproved system extensions and full disk access rules defined in configuration profiles. [Learn more about how to deploy Elastic Defend using Jamf](https://www.elastic.co/docs/solutions/security/configure-elastic-defend/deploy-on-macos-with-mdm).

***Out-of-the-box detections:**Built-in [macOS rules](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/prebuilt-rules.html), machine learning jobs, and threat intelligence integrations continue to work seamlessly on macOS Tahoe 26.

## How to upgrade to macOS Tahoe 26 with Elastic Defend

1.**Update Elastic Stack:**Ensure you are on the latest Elastic Stack and Elastic Agent version to leverage full macOS compatibility.*

2.**Deploy via MDM:**Set up system extension approvals, network content filtering, and full disk access in your MDM profile.

3.**Monitor via Fleet:**Use Kibana’s Fleet UI to track endpoint enrollment and ensure agents on macOS are functioning correctly.

4.**Test for alerts:**Confirm visibility by triggering detection rules like “Attempt to Unload Kernel Extensions” and validating event ingestion in Elastic Security.

5.**Review logs and alerts:**Go to the endpoints page in Elastic Security to make sure macOS clients show up and logs are arriving as expected.

*macOS Tahoe 26 support was added for version 8.18, 8.19, 9.0, and 9.1 as listed in the [support matrix](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#elastic-defend).
