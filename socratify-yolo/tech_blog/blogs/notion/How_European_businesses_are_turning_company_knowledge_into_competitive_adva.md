Time and time again, European business leaders I speak with describe the same experience: Their team’s collective knowledge is an incredibly valuable asset, but somehow it feels completely out of reach any time they need it.

The irony is painful. Companies invest millions in hiring brilliant people, then watch them spend hours hunting for information that definitely exists … somewhere. As a customer success leader at Notion, I support organizations across Europe. And while I see this challenge play out differently in each region, the underlying frustration is universal.

The natural response has been to add more tools, more storage, more systems to “organize” everything. But instead of solving knowledge-management challenges, it fragments information across so many places that finding anything becomes nearly impossible.

That’s why AI feels different—it’s fundamentally changing how European organizations think about and manage company knowledge. More than ever, it’s clear that using AI for knowledge management is an essential piece of what makes a successful business in 2025. Doing so helps companies find their information more easily, collaborate more effectively, and make faster decisions.

We wanted to understand how European leaders are navigating this shift, so we surveyed 650 decision-makers across the UK, France, Germany, and eight other European countries. What we discovered is that European organizations are at the forefront of using AI for knowledge management, and many are already innovating in ways that set the standard for success.

Here’s a snapshot of what we found:

  * **97% say effective knowledge management is a key driver for competitive advantage** —yet only 28% have a structured, centralized approach to managing knowledge

  * **Using multiple tools costs nearly five working weeks per employee each year** compared to using one integrated system

  * **Companies using AI for knowledge management are four times more likely to see significant cost savings** than those without AI

  * **90% say Gen Z is driving change** , demanding greater simplicity and transparency in knowledge systems




The opportunity is clear: With the right strategy, systems, and technologies in place to make better use of their knowledge, organizations can collaborate more effectively, make faster decisions, and gain a competitive edge.

There’s much more in our report, including detailed insights on how the most successful European organizations are leveraging AI for knowledge management—plus practical frameworks and benchmarking data to help you evaluate your own approach.
