```bash
python blog_downloader.py <RSS_URL> [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-o, --output`: Output directory (default: `articles`)
- `-m, --max`: Maximum number of articles to download
- `-d, --delay`: Delay between requests in seconds (default: 1.0)
- `--overwrite`: Overwrite existing files

**Examples:**
```bash
# Download from a tech blog RSS feed
python blog_downloader.py "https://example.com/blog/rss" -m 10 -o my_articles

# Download with custom delay
python blog_downloader.py "https://example.com/feed.xml" -d 2.0
```

### 2. `web_scraper.py` - Web Scraping Tool

Alternative method for blogs without accessible RSS feeds. Currently optimized for Uber's engineering blog.

**Usage:**
```bash
python web_scraper.py [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-o, --output`: Output directory (default: `articles`)
- `-m, --max`: Maximum number of articles to download (default: 10)
- `-p, --pages`: Maximum number of listing pages to scrape (default: 3)

**Usage:**
```bash
python extract_and_download.py
```

This script automatically:
1. Reads the downloaded listing page
2. Extracts individual article URLs
3. Downloads each article as a separate markdown file

## Output Format

Each downloaded article is saved as a markdown file with frontmatter metadata:

```markdown
---
title: "Article Title"
author: "Author Name"
url: "https://example.com/article"

## Customization

### Adding Support for Other Blogs

To add support for other blogs, modify the selectors in `web_scraper.py`:

```python
# Add blog-specific content selectors
content_selectors = [
    'article',
    '.post-content',
    '.your-blog-specific-selector',  # Add your selector here
    # ... existing selectors
]

# Add blog-specific link selectors
link_selectors = [
    'a[href*="/blog/"]',
    '.your-blog-post-link-selector',  # Add your selector here
    # ... existing selectors
]
```

### Adjusting Content Extraction

Modify the content extraction logic to handle blog-specific layouts:

```python
# Remove blog-specific unwanted elements
for element in soup.find_all(['script', 'style', 'nav', '.ads', '.sidebar']):
    element.decompose()
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **RSS Feed Returns 404 or "Not Acceptable"**
   - Use the web scraper instead
   - Check if the RSS URL is correct
   - Some blogs block automated requests

2. **Empty Content Extracted**
   - The blog may use JavaScript to load content
   - Content selectors may need adjustment
   - Try inspecting the HTML structure

3. **Rate Limiting Issues**
   - Increase the delay between requests
   - Some sites may block rapid requests
   - Consider using proxy rotation for large downloads

### Rate Limiting Best Practices

- Use appropriate delays (1-3 seconds minimum)
- Don't overwhelm servers with concurrent requests
- Consider the website's robots.txt
- Be respectful of bandwidth and server resources

## Files Included

- `blog_downloader.py`: RSS feed-based article downloader
- `web_scraper.py`: Web scraping tool for blog listing pages
- `extract_and_download.py`: Individual article extractor and downloader
- `README.md`: This documentation file

## Dependencies

- `feedparser`: RSS/Atom feed parsing

- `beautifulsoup4`: HTML parsing and manipulation
- `requests`: HTTP requests

## Legal Considerations

- Respect robots.txt files
- Follow terms of service for websites

# Achieving High Availability with distributed database on Kubernetes at Airbnb

## Introduction
We chose an innovative strategy of deploying **a distributed database cluster 
across multiple Kubernetes clusters in a cloud environment**...

## Managing Databases on Kubernetes  
While Kubernetes is great for stateless services, the use of Kubernetes for 
stateful services — like databases — is challenging...
