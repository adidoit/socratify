## 🎯 What Makes This System Unique

### 1. **Quality-First Approach**
Unlike generic blog scrapers, this system **prioritizes engineering depth** over quantity. Every article is scored for technical content before download.

### 2. **Curated Blog Selection**  
The 25 blogs were manually selected and ranked based on:
- Engineering team quality and reputation
- Technical depth of content  
- Consistency of high-quality posts
- Focus on architecture, systems, and engineering practices

### 3. **Anti-Marketing Filter**
Automatically filters out:
- Product launches and announcements
- Hiring and culture posts  
- Partnership and funding news
- Event promotions and webinars

### 4. **Enterprise-Grade Organization**
- Each company gets its own directory
- Consistent markdown formatting with metadata
- Preserved code blocks and technical diagrams
- YAML frontmatter with company, author, dates
