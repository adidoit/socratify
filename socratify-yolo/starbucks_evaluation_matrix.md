# Starbucks Store Experience - Exercise Evaluation Matrix

## Story Context
Starbucks is spending $450M to enhance café experience despite customers seeking faster options. This creates a tension between experience and speed that all exercises explore.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Goldilocks Zone**: Clear focus + multiple valid paths (not too open/too closed)
- **Pedagogical Quality**: Zone of proximal development, scaffolding, accessibility
- **Business Fidelity**: Realistic scenarios, accurate data, strategic plausibility

### 9. TRADE_OFF ⭐⭐ (LOWER)
- **Goldilocks**: WEAK - Choices are variations not philosophies
- **Pedagogy**: FAIR - Clear setup but limited learning depth
- **Fidelity**: GOOD - Realistic trade-offs
- **Key Weakness**: "When does this make sense" creates timing-based rather than strategic answers

## TOP 3 SELECTION

**SELECTED (Top 3):**
1. **ASSUMPTION** - Perfect Goldilocks Zone, excellent pedagogical value
2. **CONTRARIAN** - Strong contrarian framing, excellent learning value  
3. **DATA** - Practical operational focus, good business realism

**REJECTED (Move to Fail):**
- DEFINE_SUCCESS (4th best, still strong but edge cases)
- ELEVATOR_PITCH (middle tier)
- OPTIONS (middle tier) 
- QUESTIONS (middle tier)
- RESPONSE (lower tier, competitor perspective)
- TRADE_OFF (lower tier, weak choice differentiation)

## SELECTION RATIONALE

The top 3 represent the best combination of:
- **Perfect Goldilocks Zone**: Clear focus with multiple valid exploration paths
- **Maximum Learning Value**: Each teaches different strategic concepts (assumptions, contrarian thinking, operational analysis)
- **Business Authenticity**: All three present realistic, high-fidelity business scenarios
- **Complementary Perspectives**: Assumption (customer beliefs), Contrarian (overlooked factors), Data (operational needs)

These three exercises provide comprehensive coverage of the core strategic tension while maintaining the highest quality standards across all evaluation criteria.
